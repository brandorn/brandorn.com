<header class="page-intro">
	<p>Over the last seven years I've worked with corporations, nonprofits, universities, and startups to make their digital things more useful and usable. I look for projects with complex interaction and data needs.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in working together, <a href="mailto:brandon.s.dorn@gmail.com" title="">let's talk</a>.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>I work across the entire design lifecycle, from facilitating design sprints to collaborating with large teams on product redesigns. As a design generalist, I help clients hone their product strategy, identify validation approaches, prototype ideas, and create production-ready design systems.</p>
		<p>With past experience in systems architecture, I am able to work closely with developers to define data models and make designs that anticipate development constraints. And I'm knowledgeable enough in front-end languages to build static content sites and functional prototypes.</p>
		<p>My dream project? Redesigning the Library of Congress's photo archive.</p>

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>I'm skeptical about process the same way I'm skeptical about ideological thinking: it's often used as a way to avoid thinking, and causes people to ignore context and local nuance.</p>
		<p>That said, I admire two approaches to product work: the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup</a> methodology, which emphasizes continuous discovery and hypothesis validation, and the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Jobs to Be Done</a> framework, which defines the value of products based on needs they meet or activities they support.</p>
		<p>Though my actual approach varies from project to project, I nearly always do some version of these three things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Discovery.</b> Define the scope, direction, and KPIs for the project through internal workshops, interviews with stakeholders, and moderated research with key user groups.</li>
			<li><b>Prototyping and validation.</b> Create low-fidelity versions of design concepts to validate with users through rounds of testing sessions.</li>
			<li><b>Design production.</b> Design high-fidelity screens, animations, and design systems that build on existing brand guidelines or establish a new brand direction. Provide design documentation for development teams as needed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Recently I've been using <a href="https://whimsical.com/">Whimsical</a> for diagramming, wireframing, and low-fidelity prototyping, <a href="figma.com">Figma</a> for higher-fidelity prototyping and design production, <a href="https://principleformac.com/">Principle</a> for animations and transitions, <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> for design documentation, and <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> for general project documentation.</p>
		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<p>I like to read, and books themselves have become my standard for product design. I want to make digital things that are as easy to handle and learn from as a good book: accessible, durable, self-contained, unobtrusive, words and images in harmony, information presented in sequence with enough context, nice to look at for lengths of time, designed at a human scale. A vessel of generosity from author to reader.</p>
		<p>I take cues from the Bauhaus school of thought that emphasized close attention to form for the sake of content, prototyping early and often, and a practical familiarity with the methods and materials of production. I count among my influences <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>, <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>, <a href="https://pamela.is/">Pamela Pavliscak</a>, and <a href="http://13pt.com/">Jonathan Corum</a>. <a href="https://www.notion.so/brandorn/Product-Design-Resources-5e55e092a4d144ef898540cdf428c7cc">More inspiring folks here</a>.</p>
