# Brandon Dorn

## Founded 1989

<div class="resume"><a href="#" title="">Resume <span>[PDF]</span></a></div>

I'm a user experience designer at [Viget](http://viget.com), where I work on the information architecture, interaction design, and user research for digital products. I studied English Literature and Economics at Illinois Wesleyan Universityâ€“disciplines that invariably find their way into my work and thought.

Elsewhere, I post design things on <a href="http://meaningandform.tumblr.com/">Meaning and Form</a> and anythings on <a href="http://brandorn.tumblr.com/">Abundance</a>. Sometimes I use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/brandorn); [email](mailto:brandon.s.dorn@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20there) is the best way to reach me.

Born and raised on the spare planes of Illinois, I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, BethAnne, where we spend our free time in books and forests.
