<h2>Founded 1989</h2>

<div class="resume"><a href="#" title="">Resume <span>[PDF]</span></a></div>

<p>I'm a user experience designer at <a href="http://viget.com">Viget</a>, where I work on the information architecture, interaction design, and user research for digital products. I studied English Literature and Economics at Illinois Wesleyan Universityâ€“disciplines that invariably find their way into my work and thought.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, I post design things on <a href="http://meaningandform.tumblr.com/">Meaning and Form</a> and anythings on <a href="http://brandorn.tumblr.com/">Abundance</a>. Sometimes I use <a href="http://twitter.com/brandorn">Twitter</a>; <a href="mailto:brandon.s.dorn@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20there">email</a> is the best way to reach me.</p>

<p>Born and raised on the spare planes of Illinois, I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, BethAnne, where we spend our free time in books and forests.</p>
