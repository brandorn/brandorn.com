		<p>Hello over there.</p>

		<p>I'm a product designer at <a href="http://viget.com">Viget</a>, focusing on user research, prototyping, and interface design. </p>

		<p>As a designer, I take cues from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">modernist design movement</a> that emphasized close attention to form for the sake of content, prototyping early and often, and a practical familiarity with the methods and materials of production. I'm drawn to digital product design for the ways in which it blends longstanding disciplines. A good project draws on elements of information architecture and visualization, graphic design, and interaction design.</p>

		<p>An Illinois native, I live in Durham with my wife, BethAnne, where I spend my free time in books and forests, sometimes in both. Though I studied English Literature and Economics, I’ve mostly been influenced by LEGO instruction manuals and Shel Silverstein poems. <a href="mailto:brandon.dorn@gmail.com?subject=Hello there">Email</a> is a good way to reach me. Don't be a stranger.</p>

		<h2>Love Language</h2>

		<p>Brick red, afternoon errands, unassuming generosity, the quiet heavy energy of the air before a thunderstorm, the ozone smell of air after a thunderstorm, hotel breakfast buffets, the expression on people’s faces after they’re done smiling and return to their thoughts, the yin and yang of stark minimalism and human warmth in Scandinavian design, modesty, 20th c. Christian humanism, heathered fabric, hole-in-the-wall Mexican burritos, courtesy, pocket knives, club sandwiches, New Criticism, foraging for books at used book stores, the Great Plains, coffee cake, the paradoxical kindness, severity, and patience of Jesus, curiosity cabinets, mid-90s Nickelodeon, dirty realism, magical realism, the original Sambas, Midwestern hip-hop, sparkling water, unself-conscious, jargon-laced strategies of self promotion (the kind you find on LinkedIn), moments of honesty and self-revelation in otherwise sterile, professional contexts, Mahler’s 5th and 3rd (in that order), when you’re waiting at a stoplight your turn signal and synchronizes perfectly with the song you're listening to, literary marginalia, folk wisdom, brunch dates, lists, bouldering, black matte finishes, shortbread cookies, happy baby pose, the complicated, the morally ambiguous characters of the Old Testament, stores that require a moderate amount of thought and effort of their patrons and that  spell their names in all caps (e.g. ALDI and IKEA), stoccato electronic snare on top of heavy bass hits, accessible poetry, handwritten letters, Southern Gothic, non-holiday gift-giving, the idea of wonder, prairie women, essays, hand massages, cartography, ambiguity, people who listen wholeheartedly, midweight jackets, clever German compound words (they all feel clever), the month of October, coffee cake crumbles, manual hatchbacks, etc.</p>
