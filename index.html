		<h2>Hello there</h2>
		<p class="big">I'm Brandon Dorn, a digital product designer at <a href="https://viget.com">Viget</a>, where I focus on information architecture, user research, and interaction design.</p>

		<p>I’ve worked with Rotary International, The Nature Conservancy, Privia Medical Group, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Volunteers of America, State Farm, and other organizations to make their digital things more useful and usable.</p>
		<p>I like to read, and books have become my standard for product design. Seems to me a digital product should be as easy to handle and learn from as a good book: accessible, durable, self-contained, unobtrusive, words and images helping each other out, information presented in sequence with enough context, nice to look at for lengths of time, designed at a human scale. A vessel of generosity from author to reader.</p>
		<p>As a designer, I take cues from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> school of thought that emphasized close attention to form for the sake of content, prototyping early and often, and a practical familiarity with the methods and materials of production.</p>
		<p>I live in Durham with my wife, <a href="#!" class="love-hover ba">BethAnne<img src="/src/img/ba-love.png" alt=""></a>, and our scruffy dogger, <a href="#!" class="love-hover ani">Ani<img src="/src/img/ani-love.png" alt=""></a>. Before moving to North Carolina I studied English Literature and Economics in Illinois, yet have mostly been influenced by LEGO instruction manuals and Shel Silverstein poems. Recently I’ve been working on a commentary on the abundant music of <a href="http://sufjan.com">Sufjan Stevens</a>. More on that soon.</p>

		<h2>Love language</h2>
		<p class="text-secondary">The third-person omniscient, brick red, afternoon errands, unassuming generosity, the quiet heavy energy of the air before a thunderstorm, the ozone smell of air after a thunderstorm, hotel breakfast buffets, the expression on people’s faces after they’re done smiling and return to their thoughts, the yin and yang of stark minimalism and human warmth in Scandinavian design, modesty, 20th c. Christian humanism, heathered fabric, hole-in-the-wall Mexican, courtesy, pocket knives, club sandwiches, New Criticism, foraging for books at used book stores, the Great Plains, coffee cake, the paradoxical kindness, severity, and patience of Jesus, curiosity cabinets, mid-90s Nickelodeon, dirty realism, magical realism, the original Sambas, Midwestern hip-hop, sparkling water, unself-conscious, jargon-laced strategies of self promotion (the kind you find on LinkedIn), moments of honesty and self-revelation in otherwise sterile, professional contexts, Mahler’s 5th and 3rd (in that order), when you’re waiting at a stoplight your turn signal and synchronizes perfectly with the song you're listening to, literary marginalia, the extras in Portlandia, folk wisdom, brunch dates, lists, bouldering, black matte finishes, shortbread cookies, happy baby pose, the complicated, the morally ambiguous characters of the Old Testament, stores that require a moderate amount of thought and effort of their patrons and that spell their names in all caps (e.g. ALDI and IKEA), hotel continental breakfasts, stoccato electronic snare on top of heavy bass hits, accessible poetry, handwritten letters, Southern Gothic, non-holiday gift-giving, the idea of wonder, prairie women, essays, hand massages, cartography, ambiguity, people who listen wholeheartedly, midweight jackets, clever German compound words (they all feel clever), the month of October, coffee cake crumbles, manual hatchbacks, etc.</p>
