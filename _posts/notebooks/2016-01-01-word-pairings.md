<!-- Words that create some kind of <i>frisson</i>â€¦Couplings that create a tension, open a space, evoke, get stuck in my head like a song. -->

- Casual demon (from my brother)
- Origin clue (from Holly, a friend)
- Attentively evasive
- Escape velocity
- Mental hunger
- Premature nostalgia
- Casual sophistry
- Everything returns
- Cellar door (from *Donnie Darko*)
- Lucid lovers (from Kishi Bashi's "I Am the Antichrist to You")
