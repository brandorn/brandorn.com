In *The Tempest*, Shakespeare's last, everything is new and strange. A crew shipwrecks on an island during a storm roused by Prospero, usurped duke of Milan who controls the dark magic of the island with his 'liberal art.' Prospero's brother Antonio was onboard, who was the reason for Prospero's banishment to the isle and on whom Prospero seeks revenge. A series of beguiling encounters ensues between the sailors and the island's inhabitants, culminating in a series of reconciliations that return all involved to a truer version of themsleves. It is a play of wonders and chance meetings, grievances and reconciliations. Shakespeare gives us a beguiling view of what it means to be human in the fullest sense of the word.

<blockquote>
	<p>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling<br>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,<br>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply<br>Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art?</p>
