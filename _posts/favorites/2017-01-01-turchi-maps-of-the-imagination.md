title: Maps of the Imagination
author_first: Peter
author_last: Turchi
description: Using mapmaking as a central metaphor, Peter Turchi describes the writer's imaginative work by charting the connections between the verbal and visual arts. Like a good cartographer, Turchi explains without oversimplifying, explores without getting lost. What we're given is a conversation about creativity that preserves the inherent mystery of meaning-making while providing us signposts for finding our way. And the book is beautifully designed to boot.
