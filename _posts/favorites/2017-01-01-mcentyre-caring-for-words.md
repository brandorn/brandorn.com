title: Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies
author_first: Marilynne Chandler
author_last: McEntyre
description: Our words say something about who we are, more so than anything else about us. But there's more at stake with our language than self-expression. With our words we can reveal the truth or obscure it, bless or curse, encourage, heal, or damage. Our words can be creative, destructive, or merely mindless talk-show chatter just filling the silence. Marilynne McEntyre begins her series of essays by showing how words are analagous to our natural resourcesâ€“how they require thoughtful use and care to preserve their vitality. Each essay is a strategy for doing just that, presented as imperatives like "love words," "tell the truth," "play," all of which are described with a graceful candor that prevents the book from becoming pedantic. She doesn't give us exercises for improving our diction. Instead her strategies are robust and earthy, waking us up to the connective possibilities of these seemingly mundane units of thought, our words.
