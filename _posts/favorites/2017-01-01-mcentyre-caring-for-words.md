Our words say something about who we are, more so than anything else about us. But there's more at stake with our language than self-expression: with our words we can reveal the truth or obscure it, bless or curse, encourage, heal, or damage. Our words can be creative, destructive, or merely mindless talk-show chatter just filling the silence. Marilynne McEntyre begins her series of essays by showing how words are analagous to our natural resourcesâ€“how they require thoughtful use and care to preserve their vitality. Each essay is a strategy for doing just that, presented as imperatives like "love words," "tell the truth," "play," all of which are described with a graceful candor that prevents the book from becoming pedantic. She doesn't give us exercises for improving our diction; instead her strategies are robust and earthy, waking us up to the connective possibilities of these seemingly mundane units of thought, our words.

> A felicitous word choice is one that so precisely names an idea or experience that it produces for the reader or hearer a shock of recognition, a surprised 'Yes! That's it!' and a gratifying sense of having put two interlocking pieces of a puzzling world perfectly in place.

> The metaphorical habit of mind, one of the principal fruits of practicing poetry, allows us to penetrate walls of abstraction and arrive at truths accessible only by [metaphor's] means. Metaphor teaches us radical connectedness: that in this world of the five senses, all things bear meaning in relation to one another.

> I've come to believe that good reading is not possible without investment of the whole self....How we choose to read, how we submit to or question or resist the terms set by the writer, are choices that shape the habits of our minds and the habits of our hearts.
