title: Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies
author_first: Marilynne Chandler
author_last: McEntyre
description: McEntyre begins her series of essays by showing how our language is analogous to our natural resources&#58; how words require thoughtful use and care to preserve their vitality, how they have unique histories and can be used to hurt or heal. Each essay is a strategy for stewarding our language, framed by imperatives like "love words," "tell the truth," and ‚Äùplay," all of which she presents with a candor that exhibits what it teaches.
