title: Apology for Wonder
author_first: Sam
author_last: Keen
description: Keen explicates the idea of wonder like a lepidopterist working with live specimens&#58; carefully, deliberately, handling the subject without stifling or destroying it. He gives us a theory of wonder that leaves us open to the experience of it.
