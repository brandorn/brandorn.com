title: Apology for Wonder
author_first: Sam
author_last: Keen
description: I've long admired the idea of wonder, but it wasn't until I read Keen's Apology (he uses the antiquated sense of the word, meaning "a defense") that I understood what wonder is and why I admire it. And I'm still not sure that I do. But Keen's work goes a long way toward showing the place of wonder in everyday life and all that would threaten our experience of its fullness.
