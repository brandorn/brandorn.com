Lewis fought in WWI and was a professor in Oxford through WWII, so experienced firsthand the destruction and inhumanity that accompany man's insidious grasp for power. This theme haunts all of his fiction, but perhaps most clearly *That Hideous Strength*. The novel's title is taken from a poem in reference to the Tower of Babel, which forebodes the rise of a scientific-technological corporation establishing itself in rural England, the National Instute of Co-ordinated Experiments (the "N.I.C.E.", clever enough). Aside from being an exciting, multi-layered read (Lewis characteristically weaves myth, philosophy, and theology throughout) the story is a prescient cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of pursuing modern notions of progress. The problem isn't technology or science *per se*, but the scale and intent of each. What kind of world are we creating? it asks. Is it one we'll want to live in?

> For his education had had the curious effect of making things that he read and wrote more real to him than the things he saw. Statistics about agricultural labourers were the substance; any real ditcher, ploughman, or farmer's boy, was the shadow. Though he had never noticed it himself, he had a great reluctance, in his work, ever to use such words as 'man' or 'woman.' He preferred to write about 'vocational groups,' 'elements,' 'classes' and 'populations': for, in his own way, he believed as firmly as any mystic in the superior reality of the things that are not seen.

> There may have been a time in the world's history when such moments fully revealed their gravity, with whitches prophesying on a blasted heath or visible Rubicons to be crossed. but, for him, it all slipped past in a chatter of laughter, of that intimate laughter between fellow professionals, which of all earthly powers is strongest to make men do very bad things before they are yet, individually, very bad men.
