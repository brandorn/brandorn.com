title: New Seeds of Contemplation
author_first: Thomas
author_last: Merton
description: Merton is careful to tell us that contemplation isn’t something we <i>do</i> as much as it is a way of life always available to us. He shows us that the contemplative life is a leisurely yet determined attentiveness to the life of God in ourselves and in the world — a vision that isn’t <i>achieved</i>, but <i>embodied</i>.
