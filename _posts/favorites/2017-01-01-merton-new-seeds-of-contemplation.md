title: New Seeds of Contemplation
author_first: Thomas
author_last: Merton
description: Merton was well aware of spiritual faddishness when he prefaced his essays by saying that contemplation isn't 'something, an objective quality, a spiritual commodity that one can procure, something that it is good to have, something which, when possessed, liberates us from problems and from unhappiness.' He goes on to show that the contemplative way of life doesn't lead to any kind of personal gain as we usualy conceive it, because it requires the destruction of the self that longs for that kind of gain. Merton's words have a bald grace to them, at once unsettling and comforting, which indicates something of their truthfulness. He writes from experience and intuition, and his words would be harder to receive did one not feel that he speaks them to himself as much as to the reader. You never 'become a contemplative,' he seems to say throughoutâ€“you become more involved and attuned to the life of God in Christ. Contemplation is a means, not an end.
