author_first: Ray
author_last: Bradbury
description: For Bradbury, summer as a kid was a rite of passage, a tradition of confronting the wildness of the world with the courage and wonder of a kid. Thereâ€™s more than nostalgia to the collection of stories, though. They are parables about what it means to grow up in a world that is bigger than we can know.
