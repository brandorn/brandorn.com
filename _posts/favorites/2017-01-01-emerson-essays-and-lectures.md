description: Emerson’s essays are an ardent call to trust the intelligence of intuition, to think for oneself and test received wisdom against experience. For him, individual experience was something abundant and reliable yet finally mysterious. As he put it, “I cannot find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredness of private integrity.”
