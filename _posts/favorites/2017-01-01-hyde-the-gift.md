description: If you ever find yourself asking the question, “Why art?” — why music, movies, paintings, photography, books, why listen to or look at these things, why make them — then you’re who Hyde wrote for. He shows why neither art nor the artist can ever be rightly valued by modern economics, a value system that so predominates our thinking, and why a different economics — the gift economy, based on generosity and goodwill — is the rightful domain of creativity.
