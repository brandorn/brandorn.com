Lewis Hyde has forever changed how I think about art. *The Gift* puts to words half-felt hunches I've had about the unquantifiable, irreducible meaning of concerts attended and films watched and letters written. He argues that works of art are fully valued not as commodities in the marketplace, but as gifts within gift exchanges: artifacts of generosity that establish a connection between the creator and the recipient, to be given and received with goodwill. Hyde isn't naÃ¯ve about economic realities (artists can preserve their creative integrity by selling their work, and should be financially supported), but draws a clear distinction between the principles of the market and those of gift exchanges. More so than a theory of art, *The Gift* describes a graceful view of life and creativity for a culture hypnotized by market language and values.


> The passage into mystery always refreshes. If, when we work, we can look once a day upon the face of mystery, then our labor satisfies. We are lightened when our gifts rise from pools we cannot fathom. Then we know they are not a solitary egotism and they are inexhaustible. Anything contained within a boundary must contain as well its own exhaustion. The most perfectly balanced gyroscope slowly winds down. But when the gift passes out of sight and returns, we are enlivened.

> Gifts are the agents of that organic cohesion we perceive as liveliness.

> The gift that is not used will be lost, while the one that is passed along remains abundant....Satisfaction derives not merely from being filled but from being filled with a current that will not cease.
