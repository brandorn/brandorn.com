description: Lewis Hyde has forever changed how I think about art with this book. He argues that works of art are fully valued not as commodities in the marketplace, but as gifts within gift exchanges â€” artifacts of generosity that establish a connection between the creator and the recipient, to be given and received with goodwill. More so than a theory of art, he argues for a graceful view of life and creativity for a culture hypnotized by market language and values.
