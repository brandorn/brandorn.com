Christians are called to pray without ceasing, which has always felt imcompatible with the errands, work, meals, conversations, and general bustling of everyday life. Unceasing prayer as something for monks, but maybe not the rest of us. Yet Emily Herman shows us that true prayer isn't an isolated activity but an encompassing way of being. Prayer becomes more than a half hour of devotion each day–it becomes an attentiveness to God's presence as He seeks us in the midst of our quotidian milieu. Work takes on the character of prayer, so do daily commutes, and reading, and running, and sweeping, as they are revealed to be potential conduits for divine communion. Herman argues that regular moments of focused devotion are necessary, but that they aren't *sufficient*. Prayer is meant to be total. In a culture obsessed with obvious and immediate productivity, we're shown that prayer– perhaps the most seemingly unproductive of all activities–turns out to be the most efficacious of all, a glacial, landscape-shaping influence in our world.

> [Prayer] is not merely one of the noblest and most fruitful activities of the soul, at once the most intensely individual and the most comprehensively social, but the fount and the consummation of all noble activity. The fatal habit of contrasting prayer and action is deeply ingrained in the modern mind, and we persist in taking it as a mere figure of speech when we hear prayer defined as a succession of vital acts.

> Argue as we may, the saints were right. The central source of all genuinely beneficent activity is prayer. The man who 'merely' prays, if it be the prayer of communion with God, is more truly a benefactor of the race than he who endows a children's home; and the time will come when the great philanthropies will be traced back to their source in the prayers of humble, obscure folk whom the world agreed to despise. Nothing good can ever come to man except by man's union with the creative energy of God–a union which is unconsciously present in germ wherever a soul is on fire with love and compassion, and consciously realized in the prayer of communion.

> Matter is seen to be the storehouse of unguessed spiritual treasure, a hiding place of holy powers, a laboratory of Divine alchemy. Everywhere we see mysteries of healing and regeneration, of individual transfiguration and of world renewal that remained hidden while self was our center.
