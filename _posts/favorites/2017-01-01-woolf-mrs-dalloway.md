Woolf had a genius intuition for the nuances and complexities of human relationships, and had the imaginative talent to present them through flesh-and-blood characters. *Mrs. Dalloway* was one of the first novels to experiment with stream-of-consciousness prose, yet, reading it, one doesn't detect the experiment at all. It simply feels like living inside another person's mind as they navigate their quiet despairs and hopes. And Woolf cares for her characters. She isn’t a smug gossip when revealing their lives to us, but instead takes time to tell the broad, ambiguous, sublime truth of who people are. She's courteous, in other words, and magnanimous.

> And the supreme mystery which Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had solved, but Clarissa didn't believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there was another. Did religion solve that, or love? 

> We welcome, the world seemed to say; we accept; we create. Beauty, the world seemed to say. And as if to prove it (scientifically) wherever he looked at the houses, at the railings, at the antelopes stretching over the palings, beauty sprang instantly. To watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy. Up in the sky swallows swooping, swerving, flinging themselves in and out, round and round, yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them; and the flies rising and falling; and the sun spotting now this leaf, now that, in mockery, dazzling with soft gold in pure good temper; and now and again some chime (it might be a motor horn) tinkling divinely on the grass stalks–all of this, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordinary things as it was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now. Beauty was everywhere.
