description: Not a lot happens on the surface of this ruminative novel. But for John Ames, an ailing pastor in rural Iowa writing letters to his late-begotten son, the celestial motions of his soul develop a plot of their own. Robinsonâ€™s unadorned, brilliant language glimmers with melancholy light that remains with you long after reading.
