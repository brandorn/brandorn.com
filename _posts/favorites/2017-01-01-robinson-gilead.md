author_first: Marilynne 
author_last: Robinson
description: Robinson writes with the understated power and grace of a Midwestern sunset transfiguring the prairie, all fire and light and shadow. Gilead is a series of letters written from an ailing pastor in rural Iowa to his son, late-begotten in life, whom he knows he will not see grow up. Above all, these letters stand testament to the sacredness of life, and to the dignity of our joys and sorrows. They show us that meaning is found not in trying to escape our quotidian existence, but in living attentively where we find ourselves. And Robinson shows us the truth and beauty that a good, long sentence can contain.
