title: Visual Explanations
author_first: Edward
author_last: Tufte
description: Tufte is known for theorizing the work of data visualization — he would never claim to have <i>started</i> it — and his books distill centuries of discoveries and failures from a range of fields into workaday principles. Here he focuses on how evidence is used (and misused) to construct narrative graphics. The chapter on visual confections is worth its weight in gold.
