title: Till We Have Faces
author_first: CS
author_last: Lewis
description: This is a novel that feels like it contains everything&#58; the tension between what is known and what is believed, the journey of the soul as it discards its “faces” in order to live truly. It was Lewis’s last novel, and people didn’t really know what to make of it. He considered it his best. It’s hard to disagree.
