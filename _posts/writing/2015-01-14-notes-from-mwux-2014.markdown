## Themes

1. Design is the act of representing invisibilities.
1. We design from a desire to change things.
1. We can't change people; we can only create conditions conducive to change.
1. Design is risky because we cannot predict outcomes, yet this doesn't negate the possibility of serendipity.
1. Ideas are the product of purposeful play. Designers need safe places to try things out.

Ultimately, UX is about change, in the sense of improving circumstances and conditions, and UX designers have the tools, skills, and abilities to enact change.

At our best, we’re creating the conditions for productivity and meaning. This is the essence of minimalism - “the spirit of order, a unity of intention,” in the words of Le Corbusier.

Design is the uncovering of connections: thoughts, patterns, interactions that exist beneath our ordinary perception. “By mapping invisible connections in our culture, we create ways to act, to change." In corporations, we act first and then explain to others. There’s “embodied cognition.”

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Artifacts and actions</strong></td>
      <td>Visible manifestations. What we see.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Values</strong></td>
      <td>Goals, philosophies, and hopes. The logic behind impulses.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Beliefs</strong></td>
      <td>Deep, unconscious assumptions about the nature of reality.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Patterns must first be felt, plumbed, questioned before the process of solving can even dream of beginning. Always ask questions that take you to the depth of causes, which is where you must act, otherwise changes are superficial. We have to know what failed in order to know what might work. “We should map before we meddle.”

“Categories are the cornerstones of cognition and culture." Science proceeds by categorical reductionism, “optimizing the parts at the expense of the whole.”

“Sandboxes create open spaces for self-directed play and creativity.”

<blockquote>
	Humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible, cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, immature.
	<cite>Tom Robbins</cite>
</blockquote>


“If you want to eliminate risk, you're eliminating creativity.”

The Las Vegas casino epitomizes the path: "success" is defined (for the casino owners) as people's obedience to their system. This is how - we get to metrics based on "engagement"

**Platforms**: No prescribed way to use the system. **Social spaces**: people learn from each other how to use the system (positive mimicry).

<blockquote>
	Play is the answer to how anything comes about.
	<cite>Jean Piaget</cite>
</blockquote>


**Sandboxes**: are simple, customizable, lightweight, free, cooperative non-hierarchical. They don't ask much, don't tell much, have clear rules, don't force a way, involve collecting (c/t Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr), encourage exploration, require initiative.

<blockquote>
	A sandbox is a style of game in which minimal character limitations are placed on the gamer, allowing the gamer to roam and change a virtual world at will. In contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasizes roaming and allows a gamer to select tasks. Instead of featuring segmented areas or numbered levels, a sandbox game usually occurs in a “world” to which the gamer has full access from start to finish.

<blockquote>
	Design is simply moving from an existing condition to a preferred one. That’s it. It covers all cases. Nothing else is involved. Seemingly, our response to design has changed because our surroundings have changed, the environment has changed, the technology has changed. Everything bears on everything else. So yo cannot produce a change in technology without producing a change in design or a change in everything else. So one must assume the nature of change is inherent in the nature of design.

<blockquote>
	We’re not designing pages; we’re designing systems of components.
	<cite>Stephen Hay</cite>
</blockquote>


Design is the attempt to improve conditions. Considered this way, it finds itself in the same kind of work as politics. Design can create lasting change to the extent that it realizes a fundamental focus on people and systems. Always people and relationships (systems).

“The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones. We don’t design for who we are, but who we want to be.”

“Designers are the keepers of our material culture.” They represent to us vital invisibilities. Poets are the keepers of our language. They do the same. “We, as designers, make the invisible visible.” So, draw maps of processes, flows, interactions to show patterns. "Design is a tool for understanding as well as acting.”

“Artifacts exist in a context and are valued as part of a system. When you design the object, you affect the system.”

“When something breaks in your system, don’t fix it until you fully understand why it broke. Maybe it’s good that it broke. First figure out what it’s trying to tell you.” Be sensitive to conditions, context, history. “Often the experience of treatment is more traumatic than the disease itself.” We need to be careful with our solutions.
- “People collaborate and succeed despite the tools given them to do their work. Corporations function because of people’s ingenuity and resourcefulness, their unwillingness to succumb to poorly-designed processes and technology.

“Additive” innovation is perceived as more productive than “subtractive” innovation, when the latter might lead to far greater efficiency. We’re biased toward new and more. I'm reminded of CS Lewis's thought on progress in : “Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.”

Imagination is our ability to empathize. Science too precise an activity to effectively address the complexity of designing for people. By virtue of being reductive, science excludes and isolates so as to examine and understand. The imagination sees people as whole beings because it assimilates the visible and invisible. It accepts language. The imagination doesn’t respond with control, but with empathy. Science responds with will.

“Medicine isn’t based on knowing why things work, but on knowing what has worked before.” This is the essence of corporate work – do what has worked before – when the beginnings of corporations involve, to some extent, defying norms, innovating. Compare to Gordon MacKenzie in Orbiting the Giant Hairball: “Corporate Normalcy derives from and is dedicated to past realities and successes. There is no room in the Hairball of Corporate Normalcy for original thinking or primary creativity. Resynthesizing past successes is the habit of the Hairball” (p.31).

“People’s default response to the stagnation of overly-complicated [healthcare] systems is to control more, which clearly doesn’t work.” Like all other design, what is created is conditions - the parameters and tools of the sandbox. Conditions can be controlled; behavior and emotions (people) cannot. Tools are built in the name of control, innovation is conducted for the same reason. Companies want to manage risk by innovating, when innovation is inherently risky. “Innovation is typically a process of convergence when it should be a process of disruption.”

When designing, we need to consider how to protect emotions, not create them. They already exist. We can only preserve what’s there.

“People often fear the non-physical consequences of illness (social, financial, etc.) more than the illness itself. Their entire psychological state changes when they become ill, which is why the assumptions of normal behavior don’t always hold true.” Isolation is as significant a health risk as smoking.

People normalize their disease over time, sometimes to the point of accepting deeper disease. Their memory, vision of health fades.

“When everything is everywhere, what will be embodied? How will we choose to represent the infinite and the invisible?”

“Design is not about the finite, absolute solution, but about a process of moving from the unknown to the known." To know what to let go of. Build scaffolds. Don’t try to define an optimum state – just improve. We need places to practice, experiment, play. “Don’t ask people to speculate about the future. They’ll just talk about the past.” Instead, give them an experience to reflect upon.”

When creating a UX team, define very clearly the problem you’re setting out to solve. “What will happen if you aren’t successful? What are the stakes?”

## Christian Manzella

Teams are motivated by a sense of purpose. To create this, you must know what is important to them and to the business, and connect the two.

When working in an organization, teach the UX methodology: show the process and thought that go into decisions.

Always allow your team to come up with the solution. Don’t step over them and do it yourself. It’s demoralizing. Improvements can eventually be made. You’re helping them grow, which is as important as making a good product. If disagree, discuss how the solution

Interpret the culture and context of other teams – their goals and motivations. Know who’s accountable for what and let them do what they do. Don’t get distracted by trying to do their work.

Create a succession plan. Mentor others.

Don’t work more than 40 hours per week. Else, your team will have to keep up with you.

Reject the impostor syndrome. Be humble, and learn enough about others’ disciplines to be knowledgeable.

Break down business KPIs into UX responsibilities. What does the company value? What kind of data? Learn to defend decisions with objective data.
