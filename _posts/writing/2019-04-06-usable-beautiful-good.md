title: Usable, Beautiful, Good
intro: This talk concerns itself with the standards we use for digital products — what makes them humane, or less than that. It's based on an earlier talk, <a href="https://brandorn.com/tech-ethics-for-the-rest-of-us">Tech Ethics for the Rest of Us</a>.

		<p>Today we're going to be talking about design ethics, specifically the ethical dimensions of digital things. To do that, it'll help to take stock of where we're at today, as a society saturated in digital technology. There are no longer clear boundaries between our online and offline lives.</p>

		<p>We're trying to wrap our heads around these issues, to make sense of them and see how they play out in our work. At a recent company offsite, we made a list of a number of "ethical statements" that we pulled from design codes of ethics, and some we defined ourselves.</p>

		<p>Some of these statements were things like, “Product default settings should favor users‘ best interests, and should be obvious and easy to change.” Or, “Mindful deciion-making may often be a better goal for designs than efficiency of use. Where possible and appropriate, products should prompt self-reflection and critical judgment.” </p>

		<p>Some of you may recognize this guy — Tim Berners-Lee, the man who created Web technologies like the URL, hypertext, and HTTP. He anticipated many of these issues early on. In his 1999 memoir about inventing the Web, he wrote that “Information quality, bias, endorsement, privacy, and trust — fundamental values in society, much misunderstood on the Web [make it] highly susceptible to exploitation by those who can find a way.”</p>

		<p>And in a recent  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets">interview</a>, he gave an even more grim assessment: “The increasing centralization of the Web has ended up producing—with no deliberate action of the people who designed the platform—a large-scale emergent phenomenon which is anti-human.”</p>
		<p>What I find remarkable about this statement is how it expresses the way in which our technology can get away from us. No one meant for us to get to the point we're at, where advertisers or politicians can use artificial intelligence to tailor messages in specific ways to people based on demographic information. Or at least we never seriously considered the harm that could be done with such technology. Facebook is experimenting with immersive AR and hasn’t even begun to solve issues with online harassment and disinformation.</p>

		<p>All of this leaves me wondering what role I have in this as a designer, little old me, working at a tech company of 70 people. Because the more I learn about the dangers of technology, I’ve come to wonder whether I’m somehow complicit in what’s wrong, how I can avoid tacit acceptance of a destructive status quo, and what it means to make things better.</p>
		<p>So I've been trying to find principles of good design, standards for my work so that what I make is good for the world.</p>

		<p>Asking questions like, "How do I prioritize things as a designer?" Some of you may recognize this woman, Marie Kondo. I haven't read her books, but I've learned her way of folding clothes. <i>Changed my life.</i> When determining what to keep in your house, she says you should pick it up and ask if it "sparks joy." Does it bring you delight? This may be a decent principle for figuring out which jeans to keep, but the idea of "designing for delight" has its limitations. I'll talk about that in a minute.</p>

		<p>Here's a more nuanced principle from William Morris, a 19th century textiles designer, and leader in the English Arts & Crafts movement: "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful." My shovel may not "spark joy," but it's certainly useful. So we should think in terms of aesthetics <i>and</i> utility.</p>

		<p>Let's go a step further. Dieter Rams was a German industrial designer in the 20th century, famous for  highly functional and beautiful household products he designed for Braun. This is a summary of his <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">Ten Principles for Good Design</a>, a kind of ten commandments for all industrial designers.</p>

		<p>As a digital product designer, I've sought to learn from the best industrial designers, because much of what we interact with on a screen has conceptual roots in the physical world. Think of buttons, toggles, and the like. Here are some of the Rams' designs.</p>

		<p>And as an industry, we're still coming to terms with this complexity. There's a <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/">website</a> that catalogs literally hundreds of design principles written by individuals and organizations. Some of these are very good — I encourage you to check them out. But often the problem with design principles is that they are short sighted: looking only at the thing itself, and not thinking about its effect on the world.</p>

		<p>I like this thought, from Mike Monteiro's <a href="https://muledesign.com/2017/07/a-designers-code-of-ethics">Designer's Code of Ethics</a>: “A designer values impact over form.We need to fear the consequences of our work more than we love the cleverness of our ideas...Society is the biggest system we can impact and everything you do is a part of that system, good and bad. Ultimately we must judge the value of our work based on that impact.” These impacts aren't always obvious, but we need to be training ourselves to think this way.</p>

		<p>Cennydd Bowles expresses this really well. “The strategies that create desirable products also foster addiction….That we find it difficult to tease apart addiction and desire speaks to the failure of the experience design movement. Designers haven’t interrogated the difference between enjoyable and habitual use, and the rhetoric of designing for delight has directly contributed to addiction.”</p>
		<p>This isn't to say that designing for delight is inherently bad, but that it‘s a questionable end in itself.</p>

		<p>Ethics doesn’t give answers, but prompts questions to help you find answers. It isn’t just about being nice; it’s about interrogating our work. Holding it up against the things we value. Jacques Ellul, a 20th century sociologist of technology, puts it like this: “Ethics is not a matter of formulating principles but of knowing how to evaluate an action in particular circumstances.” Evaluating an action in context.</p>

		<p>That question brings us back to the question of what makes something good — the ethics of designed objects. There are many ways to approach this question. I won't go into too much detail here, but generally speaking, people either locate ethics in the <i>designer</i>, transcribing their values into an object, or in the broader culture, which informs how an object is used. You can also look at the goals of the people using it, and how usage evolves the design over time.</p>

		<p>For the purposes of today‘s conversation, I‘ll focus on the ways in which digital technologies either support or hinder human values. Here’s a list that gives us a good place to start — what authors Friedman and Kahn call the “<a href="/img/writing/tech-ethics/human-values-ethics-and-design.pdf">human values with ethical import</a>.”</p>
		<p>We take many of these values for granted as conscientious designers. But they can serve as a rubric for evaluating designs. Remember, ethics is the act of evaluating actions in context.</p>

		<p>Take trust, for example. We trust someone when they reliably treat us fairly and respectfully. In an interface, this means that buttons do what we expect them to when we click them, or content is clear and up-to-date. Many dark patterns take advantage of people’s trust by using a common interaction pattern in an unpredictable way.</p>

		<p>Like the Windows 10 Modal a few years back. Normally, when you click a “close” link in a modal, the modal closes and you cancel the action. Microsoft was getting impatient with people who weren’t upgrading, though, so they ended up changing the behavior of the close link. Instead of hiding the modal, clicking “close” agreed to the update. The technical term for this is a <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/bait-and-switch" title="">bait and switch</a>.</p>
		<p>I like what one commenter <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/67367/upgradegate-microsofts-upgrade-deceptions-undermining-windows-10">said about this</a>: “It’s like going out to your car in the morning and discovering that the gas pedal now applies the brakes, while the brake pedal washes the windshield.

		<p>The value of identity is a little less obvious. It has to do with the way that people are represented in digital systems. Psychologists remind us that our personalities are unified and multiple. I am one person, but I am a slightly different person at work than I am at home, or when hanging out with my brother, or when walking my dog through the woods.</p>
		<p>What we need to always keep in mind is that digital representations of people are inherently reductive. People cannot be fully represented by a system, digital or otherwise, because they are being represented on the system’s terms. We inherently know this. Our Facebook or Instagram or Medium profiles only show a little of who we are.</p>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gaines_(artist)">Charles Gaines</a> dealt with this in idea in his paintings in the 70s. I actually saw some of Gaines‘ work at the Nasher last summer, which is where I first learned about him. In some of his pieces, he would take a photograph, then begin abstracting it to show how systems distort people and things even as they try to represent them. They “objectified people beyond recognition,” to use the words of one commentator.</p>

		<p>Sometimes the digital things we make our beautiful. But we can’t forget that we are making systems that represent real people and things. It’s up to us create systems avoid reductiveness to the extent that they can. To allow ambiguity and fullness of expression and representation. This is obviously a complex thing to accomplish.</p>

		<p>Let’s look at one more value: calmness. At this point in the game, we’re all growing tired of our devices shouting at us. We’re getting better about this as a society: you don’t hear ringtones very much anymore in public (though they can still be handy). And alert settings have improved, with things like Do Not Disturb mode. </p>

		<p>Alerts are an annoyance on our devices, but as we move into an era of ubiquitous computing, where computers are embedded into environments, alerts and notifications can become serious issues. We need to learn to make technology that remains passive and peripheral, announcing itself only when absolutely necessary.</p>

		<p>So myself and a few designers at Viget worked on a <a href="https://explorations.viget.com/fridge/">design concept</a> that thought about what it would be like for appliances to have screens but remain unobtrusive. Instead of letting you check your email while filling up a glass of water, how could a refrigerator interface preserve the ways people currently use their refrigerators? What if we didn’t try to co-opt the space by slapping an iPad on it?</p>

		<p>So we thought about how a display could still allow people to post physical objects, but draw next to them on a digital e-ink display. E-ink is a lovely technology: it’s easy on the eyes in the way LED screens aren’t, and remarkably energy efficient. We tried to design an interface that remained peripheral to the life of the family.</p>

		<p>Apple introduced a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/">default utility</a> in iOS 12 that prevents access to apps around certain times of day. You can still access them, but it'll ask if you want to ignore your screen time limits first. It'll also show you your weekly app usage. Sometimes this is depressing to me. But it can be encouraging too. We're realizing we want to be on our screens less, and these kinds of features help us in that way.</p>
		<p>It's worth noting that Apple is interested in these features in a way that Google, Facebook, and Twitter typically aren't, because Apple's business model is different: they make most of their money on selling products and services rather than ads. But even for companies with ad-based business models, features like these send a signal that they see you as a person, not just a means to profit.</p>

		<p>Because here's the thing: values-based technology is the future. It's the future in the same way that renewable energy and sustainable food production is the future. These practices run counter to the shortsighted profit motive that defines our economy. They take a longer look at human welfare. It took society a long time to catch up to these ideas. Public opinion is just beginning to shift, thanks in large part to seeing Silicon Valley executives testifying before Congress. And though sustainable energy and food production practices are catching on, they aren't yet pervasive — at least not in the US. The ethical design movement can learn a lot from the organic and clean energy movements.</p>

The apps on the left are generally straightforward utilities, practical, single-use, idiosyncratic, aid focus and reflection, don‘t demand attention, may be social, but only secondarily. Many have a <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/835799/why-humans-love-technology-that-does-literally-only-thing">single purpose</a>.
