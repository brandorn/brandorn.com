title: A Working Design Approach
location: Bloomington
---

I've never worked on a project that proceeded linearly from idea to final product. More often than not, a project is a learning process that accumulates into something that couldn't have been predicted at the start. Mostly I go about my work Socratically, asking myself what I need to know and do at each step and figuring out how to do it.

That said, I've come to recognize a sequence of phases that loosely constitute an approach to design: *listen*, *connect*, *design*, and *produce*. These are an adaptation of the fourfold creative process espoused by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), [Jonathan Corum](http://13pt.com/corum/), and [Maria Popova](http://www.brainpickings.org/about/) in their presentation “See, Think, Design, Produce,” modified by reflections on my experience as a user experience designer. The process isn't a recipe for successful projects; rather, it's a way of thinking about how things are made. It requires one to think critically and be sensitive to the needs and nuances of the project, rather than rely on someone else's technique. And because no particular methods are prescribed, the phases can be brought to bear on most any kind of work.

## Listen

All design begins in [listening](https://ia.net/know-how/putting-thought-into-things). Listening is learning, seeing, hearing, attending, all of which are the opposite of presuming. Listening to others, learning about situations, looking for clues, paying attention to our hunches. When we listen, we get ourselves out of the way so that we can hear what someone is actually saying and come to see the reality of a situation. Listening is a profoundly intentional act, because it requires that we overcome the tendency to prescribe answers. It is also a humble act, because we expose our ignorance when we ask honest questions.

All design begins in listening because design is the forever attempt to improve our circumstances, and the only way we can know what is wrong is through sensitivity to context. Listening holds first impressions lightly. And listening is the natural corollary of curiosity: talking with people, reading about relevant subjects, studying the ways a problem has been solved before (how others have succeeded and failed).

At the outset each design project I seek to inhabit a posture of receptiveness, knowing that past solutions won't fit the unique design problem at hand.

## Connect

We make sense of things by connecting: finding the relationships between this and that. If listening is about gathering information, connecting is about making sense of it. When we connect, we look for patterns (things that repeat) and incongruities (things that don’t jive). Patterns help account for similarity among diversity, and shape the form of a logical system. Incongruities–the outliers and oddities–are just as important, for they can indicate the presence of deeper, less obvious realities. When something doesn’t fit a model, that means the model isn’t nuanced or big enough; the model doesn’t reflect the truth, and needs to be revised. So we relate and revise, relate and revise.

My tools for connecting are basic. I like to use paper, pencil, and post-its to take notes, cluster ideas and questions, and freely discuss thoughts with my teammates. Connecting is a relatively messy task (think those cork boards in detective offices covered in pushpinned photos and printouts and sketches), yet the diagrams, notes, summaries, and documents that emerge at the end become the tools of thought for the rest of the design process.

## Design

The word “design” comes from the Latin *designare*, from which we get the word “designate.” So, to design is to give something intention, to put thought into a thing. Design gives shape to an idea. It gives an idea some work clothes.

By this point data has been gathered, some sense has been made of it, yielding the material and direction needed to design. Sketching is the best way to experiment with forms to fit the content of any project. A sketch isn’t a commitment; it’s an attempt. It's about trying to come up with micro and macro systems appropriate to the data.

A childlike, playful seriousness is needed to design. Watching children play at dolls or Legos, you notice their all-consuming attentiveness to the activity as they enact what they imagine. They are caught up in their own world of rules and possibilities, inventors of their own conventions. This spirit of play creates in the designer an openness to possible solutions, a kind of intellectual pliability. The first ideas are rarely the best, yet the cutting room floor isn’t covered with trash; it’s covered in something more like a wood-carver’s shavings that are scattered as he hones his art.

## Produce

Production brings something out of the realm of the possible into the actual. Listening gathers information; connecting makes sense of it; designing puts form to it; producing makes it accessible for others. As Edward Tufte puts it, "The act of producing causes the results of seeing and reasoning to have consequences beyond themselves." The act of production brings considerations of a product’s architecture, use, and interpretation into sharp focus, which invariably prompt vital, unforeseen refinements.

Production is the final test of an idea. Does it hold up? If not, what about it does or doesn't? What needs to change? It isn't enough to make something: understanding its effect (or lack thereof) in the world is the necessary gauntlet for successful things.

The length and activities of each phase vary from one project to the next, and invariably they overlap and cycle back to each other. You learn something that requires you to do further research more and adjust what seemed to be a watertight concept. But take heart: you aren't spinning on a hamster wheel, you're walking a slowly ascending spiral as you return to each phase the wiser.
