<p><a href="https://www.priviahealth.com/">Privia Health</a> is a national healthcare organization that helps hospitals and privately-owned practices improve access to care with technology. The company has a population health focus, meaning that they work with their customers to develop strategies that incentivize <i>keeping patients healthy</i> rather than profiting when they need medical care, a shift in perspective that the U.S. is slowly learning from other countries, like Japan.</p>

<p>Over the last few years I have worked with Privia's product team on products for their various audiences: primary care providers, nurse staff, and patients. We've held workshops, done in-person ethnographic research, and built prototypes to test before scaling solutions across their networks.</p>

	<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	<ol class="learned-things">
		<li><p><b>Anticipate worst-case mental states.</b> More so than other types of digital products, those used by healthcare professionals and their patients need to be designed for the stresses and anxieties and distractions of <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-real-life">real life</a>. This should influence decisions from information architecture all the way down to microcopy.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Design for situational awareness.</b> When care providers are assessing patient's medical records, they are scanning sometimes hundreds of data points for anomalies, not unlike aircraft pilots glancing over their dashboards. It was important to learn <i>from them</i> how to prioritize data and make it appropriately scannable, providing just enough information without introducing undue cognitive burden.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Learn to love constraints.</b> Given the level of regulation in the medical industry, many requirements were predetermined and out of our control. However, this forced us to be even more focused on accessibility and clarity in the designs.</p></li>

<h2>The Work</h2>
<p>Shown here are some of the projects I've worked on with Privia, from private practice marketing websites to a recording UI used by providers to document and transcribe patient visits.</p>

<p>Above is an interface used by providers for viewing patient-related tasks and documenting visits. One goal of the interface was to clearly present patients' care plans, a document meant to keep providers and patients on the same page (literally) about steps to take to manage ongoing health conditions.</p>

<p>We wanted to allow care providers a way to quickly glance over a patient's medical history to identify any recent events or recurring patterns. This timeline view categorizes events in rows on a timeline, highlighting acute events and giving access to further detail.</p>

<p>Privia was an early entrant into online telehealth, giving providers and patients the option to meet virtually for consultations that didn't require in-person visits. I helped them design marketing websites for their care centers as well as the onboarding flow and chat interface for their telehealth platform.</p>

<p>To reduce the amount of patient documentation providers are required to write on a daily basis, we designed a recording utility that syncs with providers' calendars and frees them to focus on patients during visits. Recordings are then sent to a third party for transcription, and providers receive notes from their visits at the end of the day.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Although Privia is a healthcare organization, they see themselves as a technological innovation company seeking to improve how healthcare is done. But they aren't interested in "disruption" or gimmicks. Rather, they have taken a long look at how healthcare needs to change in the United States and are helping customers make that change. While none of the products above will individually bring that about, each connect to Privia's broader mission of transforming healthcare â€” one I was happy to be a part of.</p>
