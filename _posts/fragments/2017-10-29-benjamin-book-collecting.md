I read a passage in Walter Benjamin's essay "Unpacking My Library" the other day that made me feel better about my unshakeable habit of buying books far more frequently than I read them:

<blockquote>
	<p>The book borrower of real stature whom we envisage here proves himself to be an inveterate collector of books not so much by the fervor with which he guards his borrowed treasures and by the deaf ear which he turns to all reminders from the everyday world of legality as by his failure to read these books. If my experience may serve as evidence, a man is more likely to return a borrowed book upon occasion than to read it. And the non-reading of books, you will object, should be characteristic of collectors? This is news to me, you may say. It is not news at all. Experts will bear me out when I say that it is the oldest thing in all the world. Suffice it to quote the answer which Anatole France gave to a philistine who admired his library and then finished with the standard question, “And you have read all these books, Monsieur France?” “Not one-tenth of them. I don't suppose you use your Sèvres china every day?</p>
</blockquote>

As it turns out, the Japanese have a word that captures this literary impulse: **Tsundoku** (n.): "Buying books and not reading them; letting books pile up unread on shelves or floors or nightstands."

<a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/tsundoku-should-enter-the-english-language.html">Open Culture</a> describes the word's origins:

<blockquote>
	<p>The word dates back to the very beginning of modern Japan, the Meiji era (1868-1912) and has its origins in a pun. <i>Tsundoku</i>, which literally means <i>reading pile</i>, is written in Japanese as 積ん読. <i>Tsunde oku</i> means to let something pile up and is written 積んでおく. Some wag around the turn of the century swapped out that oku (おく) in <i>tsunde oku</i> for <i>doku</i> (読) – meaning to read. Then since <i>tsunde doku</i> is hard to say, the word got mushed together to form <i>tsundoku</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

Why do we do this? Our piles of books speak to the hopes we have for ourselves, what we hope to learn, to experience, how we hope to grow. I've come to accept that I'll probably never read all of the books I own, much less all of the books I want and will want to read. Yet the sight of them carries a sense of potential, what I imagine a farmer feels when looking at a new plot of land, or an artist feels when looking at a stack of blank canvases.
