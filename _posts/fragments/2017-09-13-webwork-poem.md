title: Work Life, a Sonnet
---

Do spiders tire of weaving honest webs? <br>
Proportions true, each strand strung as precise <br>
as Euclid's lines. Unflagging, never ebbs, <br>
Their pride of craft ([once cursed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne)) suggests advice. <br>

Fair morning light reveals keen intellect <br>
Practiced beneath an eight-eyed stellar gaze. <br>
The new forms fix what failed, so flaws direct <br>
Each weaver onward, griefless in their ways. <br>

Disaster does not dull their perfect art; <br>
Unseen, unheard, laboring at their gift <br>
Like calm Tibetan monks who from the start <br>
Accept their sand arrays will be swept swift. <br>

Arachnids demonstrate aesthetic sense: <br>
The life and death of will gifts represent.
