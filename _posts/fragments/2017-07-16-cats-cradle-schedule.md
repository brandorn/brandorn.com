This is the kind of schedule that venue staff hand out after shows at [Cat’s Cradle](http://catscradle.com/), a long-time venue in Carrboro, NC, just west of Chapel Hill. The schedule small, relevant, and indy, just like the venue itself.

After picking up a couple of these, I began noticing how thoughtfully-designed they were despite being throwaway strips of paper.

Marketing is rarely informative or considerate of readers. And marketing that aspires to be useful usually just ends up as a gimmick (see: refrigerator magnets). This schedule accomplishes each of these things and more.

The flyer is genuinely helpful (it will be a useful reference for 3+ months), makes credible assumptions about its readers (people receiving the flyer don't need Cat's Cradle explained to them), cuts to the chase (no preamble, just schedule), is easy to produce (any word processing software could be used, making it easy to update, print, and cut the day of a show), is economical (3 flyers can be printed on a 8.5” × 11” page), isn't merely marketing in disguise, and, maybe most remarkably, is generous, promoting shows at other venues in the area to bolster the local music culture.

The content is the design. This kind of thoughtful typography and information architecture bears the mark of refinement over time by people who care about what they do and who they do it for.

The type is admittedly small, but the density of information that they've fit into 27.5 square inches is admirable. And it isn't as though we aren't used to holding up small type to our faces for better resolution. I heard a guy complain to his son that he could barely read it, only to then pick up his phone and start reading. And unlike most phone interfaces, this one rewards a closer look.
