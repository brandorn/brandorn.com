title: Design Is a Decision-Making Activity
---

Any designed thing, whether a car or a cup or a carousel, is a cumulation of design decisions. Things like layout, size, material, sequence, proportion, color, texture, motion, sound, language – the attributes of an object – never arrive into the world willy-nilly, but are the result of someone, somewhere choosing to make something a certain way. As designers, our role is bring our experience, intuition, and reason to bear on each decision such that they combine to make something coherent, maybe even beautiful. When we say something is designed well, one of the things we mean is that all an object’s attributes perform well together. There is a harmony to the way the form carries out the function.
