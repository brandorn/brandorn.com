title: Thinking as Feeling
---

When I’m not thinking about the words people use, I’m usually thinking about their sentences. The way they structure them, how they’re spoken, what their words are hiding or revealing. What people are really thinking, which is what we’re all after, after all. This is why we read literature, I think: to experience the mind of someone else in a way that ordinary language usually doesn’t satisfy.

Sentences are the foundation of thought. The sentences we think or speak may not always be complete, or may run on, or may be single words, like “No.” But they are inescapably sentences in the way that music always has a rhythm, even if it is erratic, and paintings are always composed of color, even if only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/01/31/arts/20080203_VOGE_SLIDESHOW.html?mcubz=3">variations of grey</a>. We cannot make meaning without making sentences, and our sentences begin in inarticulate, felt meanings.

Wendell Berry puts it like this:

<blockquote>
  <p>When we reflect that “sentence” means, literally, “a way of thinking” (Latin: <i>sententia</i>) and that it comes from the Latin <i>sentire</i>, to feel, we realize that the concepts of sentence and sentence structure are not merely grammatical or merely academic - not negligible in any sense. A sentence is both the opportunity and the limit of thought - what we have to think with, and what we have to think in. It is, moreover, a feelable thought, a thought that impresses its sense not just on our understanding, but on our hearing, our sense of rhythym and proportion. It is a pattern of felt sense.</p>
  <cite>Wendell Berry, <i>Standing By Words</i></cite>
</blockquote>

Berry argues that thought begins and ends in feeling and depends on it, that we cannot think without feeling. Of course, feeling can inhibit thinking when we concede our reason to emotion. We can err in either direction: feeling without thinking, thinking without feeling. One is the error of the angry mob, the other the error of the solitary philosopher. What becomes clear is that the only path toward trustworthy judgment – toward *sense* – is the right interdependence of the heart and the mind. 

When our thoughts are wed with our felt experience, they can change us and change others. It seems to me our words take on this potency *only when* they are grounded in our experience. They loose the cords of our solitude, binding us to the world once again, which we experience as the return of sanity and calm. As James Agee has written, “The mind and the spirit are constantly formed by, and as constantly form, the senses, and we misuse or neglect the senses only at grave peril to every possibility of wisdom and wellbeing.” 

Joanne Diaz’ poem “The Griffin” meditates on this reciprocal formation:

  <p class="title">The Griffin</p>
  <p class="poet"> by Joanne Diaz</p>
  <p>
    For George Herbert, thinking meant feeling; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a sermon on the complexities of predestination <br>
    <br>
    was as exciting as a country girl sitting in the front pew. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I learned this lesson best years ago <br>
    <br>
    from a tutor in Oxford who met with me each Tuesday. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her last name was Griffin, which was, I thought <br>
    <br>
    the most interesting thing about her. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our meetings were dismal for both of us: <br>
    <br>
    I thought rhymed poetry was a bore <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and she kept squinting toward the tiny desk clock <br>
    <br>
    for the minute she could be alone again. One afternoon, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after several like this, she must have decided <br>
    <br>
    that reading aloud could help. She cleared her throat, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adjusted her giant glasses, opened to “The Collar,” <br>
    <br>
    and read. With her Cornish lilt, she lingered <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over <span class="italic">Shall I ever sigh and pine?</span> as if it were <br>
    <br>
    her own question, and by the time she got to, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="italic">Is the year only lost to me?</span> she seemed to have forgotten <br>
    <br>
    Herbert, and me, altogether. I saw a struggle in her, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heard a tightening in her throat, then a gasp <br>
    <br>
    after she uttered the final words, and then <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she nearly left the prison of her body, her tears <br>
    <br>
    revealing that she really was part lion, part eagle. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How often have I read Herbert’s poem in the years since, <br>
    <br>
    only to hear the unexplained weeping, and the choler <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that bound the griffin, even as she flexed her wings.<br>

  </p>

The poem is about the tutor's return to sense from her chill academic aloofness, the intrusion into her intellectual solitude of a felt connection to the world. It is significant that she reads the poem out loud: rather than only being perceived intellectually, Herbert's words are audible, and *felt*.  The change begins in the tutor as the narrator fades from view, and the tutor begins reading Herbert's words as if they were “her own.” By the end, the tutor nearly leaves “the prison of her body,” nearly living into some fullness of her true self by leaving behind her stodgy solitude to return to her creaturely wildness: “she really was part lion, part eagle.”

The tutor's true self is revealed, though it isn't embraced. This is the tragedy of the poem, which takes on dimension when we consider Diaz's pun of the word “choler.” Choler was one of the four bodily humors of medieval science, thought to be “associated with a peevish or irascible temperament.” In Herbert's poem (below), we learn that the collar is in fact self-imposed: “Forsake thy cage, / Thy ropes of sand, / which petty thoughts have made.” It is a chosen restraint, his Christian devotion, that Herbert rebels against, feeling that it is preventing experience of the world: ”leave thy cold dispute / Of what is fit and not.” He worries he is missing out on life: “Is the year lost only to me?” which is the same concern aroused in the tutor when she reads his line. Each poem ends ambiguously, leaving the tutor and Herbert's narrator with their separate promises of freedom within constraint.

  <p>
    I struck the board, and cried, “No more; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will abroad! <br>
    What? shall I ever sigh and pine? <br>
    My lines and life are free, free as the road, <br>
    Loose as the wind, as large as store. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall I be still in suit? <br>
    Have I no harvest but a thorn <br>
    To let me blood, and not restore <br>
    What I have lost with cordial fruit? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure there was wine <br>
    Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before my tears did drown it. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is the year only lost to me? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have I no bays to crown it, <br>
    No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All wasted? <br>
    Not so, my heart; but there is fruit, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou hast hands. <br>
    Recover all thy sigh-blown age <br>
    On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute <br>
    Of what is fit and not. Forsake thy cage, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy rope of sands, <br>
    Which petty thoughts have made, and made to thee <br>
    Good cable, to enforce and draw, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be thy law, <br>
    While thou didst wink and wouldst not see. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Away! take heed; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will abroad. <br>
    Call in thy death's-head there; tie up thy fears; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He that forbears <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To suit and serve his need <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deserves his load.” <br>
    But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At every word, <br>
    Methought I heard one calling, <i>Child!</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I replied <i>My Lord</i>. <br>
