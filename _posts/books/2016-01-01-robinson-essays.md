I was enthralled by Marilynne Robinson's fiction, and then found out that she writes essays. Lucid, impassioned essays about things like democracy, American history, theology, the prevalance of fear and cynicism in society, and nuclear waste. Hers are essays in the truest sense: the patient, critical testing of ideas (her own and others') in search of the truth of things. But as in her fiction, the seriousness of her subject matter is handled with wry sincerity as she disassembles conventional wisdom ("Everything always bears looking into") or reflects on the contradictions and wonder of being human.

Robinson's essays reveal the maturation of an enduring curiosity and generous faith, and show that literacy can be developed (she's an inveterate reader of primary sources) free of pretension. These collections are a celebration of the mind, and we are as astonished at her insight as she is. I recommend all of them. Each book is as expansive and original as the rest. Hopefully there are more to come.

	<p>What we are taught in classrooms is a very minor part of what we learn from ambient experience, which will teach us that learning itself is suspect, not an attempt at some meaningful vocabulary of reflection but instead an affectation, a kind of idleness or triviality that deserves the name 'elitism,' and that has no purpose except to assert a claim to superiority.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Our genes are not fixed like beads on a string, the physical world is not simple and solid, to be meaningful a statement need not be falsifiable, nor is it falsified in its not satisfying a particular, sometimes tendentious, standard of meaning or truth.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>As a layperson who has spent a great many hours listening to sermons, I have an other than academic interest in preaching, an interest in the hope that I, and so many others, bring into the extraordinary moment when someone attempts to speak in good faith, about something that matters, to people who attempt to listen in good faith. The circumstance is moving in itself, since we poor mortals are so far enmeshed in our frauds and shenanigans, not to mention our self-deceptions, that a serious attempt at meaning, spoken and heard, is quite exceptional. It has a very special character.</p>
