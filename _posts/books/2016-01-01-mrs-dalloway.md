Woolf had a genius intuition for the nuances and complexities of relationships, and had the imaginative talent to present them through flesh-and-blood characters. Mrs. Dalloway was one of the first novels to experiment with stream-of-consciousness prose, yet, reading it, one doesn't detect the experiment at all. It simply feels like living inside another person's mind as they navigate their quiet despairs and hopes.
