Using mapmaking as a central metaphor, Peter Turchi describes the writer's imaginative work by charting the connections between the verbal and visual arts. Like a good cartographer, Turchi explains without oversimplifying, explores without getting lost. What we're given is a conversation about creativity that preserves the inherent mystery of meaning-making while providing us signposts for finding our way. And the book is beautifully designed to boot.

> This is the mystery of meaning in art. Meaning is there, but not the way Exit 55 is *there*; meaning is there, somewhere; there to be found. But it isn't buried treasure. It's more like an energy-line apparent to a feng shui master....Meaning in art is there all the time, or it is never there; it can be seen from a particular perspective, but only if we have been prepared to see it.

> The tension between our vision for the work and the form we choose mirrors the tension between the world in its incomprehensible vastness and our attemtps to make sense of it.

> We can never move beyond our perceptions and understanding; but fiction and poetry, in expanding the world of our imagination beyond the world of our experience, allows us a more intimate–and so more thorough, and perhaps more compassionate–imaginative knowledge of our fellow beings than we are likely ever to have in the course of our daily lives.
