Although Carl Sandburg was a serious man–he fought for labor rights during the Industrial Revolution through politics and poetry–he also wrote playful children's literature. I keep this collection of non sequiturs, folk wisdom, and strange, lovely short stories nearby for whenever I need respite from the intellectual intensity of a project or class. Sandburg reminds me that silliness can restore sanity.
