Literary theory has given literary criticism a bad name. This is a theory of reading that does what criticism should do: eagerly return us to books. Lewis had an abiding love for the act of reading and the life of the imagination, and here presents a refreshing, sane account of how we should think about books. He argues that the worth of a book should be determined by the kind of reading it requires of us. I return to Experiment when I need to be reminded about literature's transformative effect on our lives, and how to read with humility and openness.
