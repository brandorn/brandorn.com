Literary theory has given literary criticism a bad name with esoteric arguments that obscure the pleasure of the experience of reading and talking about good books. Lewis puts together a theory of reading that does what criticism should: eagerly send us to the library (or our Amazon wish lists). He had an abiding love for the act of reading and the life of the imagination, and makes a winsome argument for what makes good books good. Avoiding academic elitism on the one hand and wishy-washy relatavism on the other, he argues that the worth of a book should be determined by the *kind of reading it evokes*. It all comes back to a personal response to a work. I return to *An Experiment* to remember the transformation that literature can bring about in us when we read with humility and openness. And as someone once put it to me, the epilogue itself is worth its weight in gold.

> We are so busy doing things with the work that we give it too little chance to work on us. Thus increasingly we only meet ourselves. But one of the chief operations of art is to remove our gaze from that mirrored face, to deliver us from that solitude.

> No poem will give up its secret to a reader who enters it regarding the poet as a potential deceiver, and determined not to be taken in. We must risk being taken in, if we are to get anything. The best safeguard against bad literature is a full experience of the good; just as a real and affectionate acquiantance with honest people gives a better protection against rogues than a habitual distrust of everyone.

> My own eyes are not enough for me; I will see through the eyes of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented.
