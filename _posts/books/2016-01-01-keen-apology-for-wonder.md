I've long admired the idea of wonder, but it wasn't until I read Keen's *Apology* (he uses the antiquated sense of the word, meaning "a defense") that I understood what wonder is and why I admire it. And I'm still not sure that I do. But Keen's work goes a long way toward showing the place of wonder in everyday life and all that would threaten our experience of its fullness. *Apology for Wonder* is a handbook for those who would become childlike, living graciously and generously in the valley of the shadow.

> It is too often assumed that the mysterious is equivalent to the unknown and that, in the light of adequate knowledge, mystery will give way to clarity. Such a view equates mystery and ignorance....The more intimately known and ardently loved a place, thing, or person is, the more mysterious it is...Knowledge destroys mystery and wonder only when it is used hostilely to reduce the dimensions of meaning in an object to those that can be manipulated and controlled.

> Freedom to create and act are possible only where there exists a continuing openness and receptivity to the givenness of life and a continuing movement toward transcending the given.

> The more the self is at home in the world it has created by accepting and defining its gifts and limits, the freer it is to wander and appreciate strangeness. Ontological security and ontological wonder increase proportionately.

> Finally, the most significant index we have of the stature of a man is the amount of pain and tragedy he has been able to bear and still rejoice in the gift of life.
