Ray Bradbury wrote grown-up children's stories made of the stuff of dreams and nightmares and longing. *Dandelion Wine* is my favorite of his. The novel is a series of interconnected short stories set in a small town in Illinois (roughly based on his hometown of Wuakegan, he admits) that are folk parables about dignity, kindness, sorrow, loneliness, and the friendship that keeps us going when all seems to conspire our way. The writing is entrancing: his metaphors dance and abound, and are so vivid for their inventiveness. Encountering his soulful stories–Bradbury wrote nothing without heart–makes one pine for childhood and receive it anew. 

> All I know is I feel good going to bed nights, Doug. That's a happy ending once a day. Next morning I'm up and maybe things go bad. But all I got to do is remember that I'm going to bed that night and just lying there a while makes everything okay.

> When you are away from a city it becomes a fantasy. Any town, New York, Chicago, with its people, becomes improbable with distance. Just as I am improbable here, in Illinois, in a small town by a quiet lake. All of us improbable to one another because we are not present to one another.

> And, after all, isn't that what life is all about, the ability to go around back and come up inside other people's heads to look out at the damned fool miracle and say: oh, so that's how you see it!? Well, now, I must remember that.
