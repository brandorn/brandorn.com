Merton was well aware of spiritual faddishness when he prefaced his essays by saying that contemplation isn't 'something, an objective quality, a spiritual commodity that one can procure, something that it is good to have, something which, when possessed, liberates us from problems and from unhappiness.' He goes on to show that the contemplative way of life doesn't lead to any kind of personal gain as we usualy conceive it, because it requires the destruction of the self that longs for that kind of gain. Merton's words have a bald grace to them, at once unsettling and comforting, which indicates something of their truthfulness. He writes from experience and intuition, and his words would be harder to receive did one not feel that he speaks them to himself as much as to the reader. You never 'become a contemplative,' he seems to say throughoutâ€“you become more involved and attuned to the life of God in Christ. Contemplation is a means, not an end.

> Our vocation is not simply to *be*, but to work together with God in the creation of our own life, our own identity, our own destiny. We are free beings and sons of God. This means to say that we should not passively exist, but actively participate in His creative freedom, in our own lives, and in the lives of others, by choosing the truth. To put it better, we are even called to share with God the work of *creating* the truth of our identity....To work out our own identity in God, which the Bible calls 'working out our salvation,' is a labor that requires sacrifice and anguish, risk and many tears. It demands close attention to reality at every moment, and great fidelity to God as He reveals Himself, obscurely, in the mystery of each new situation.

> For whatever is demanded by truth, by justice, by mercy, or by love must surely be taken to be willed by God. To consent to His will is, then, to consent to be true, or to speak truth, or at least to seek it.

> The function of faith is not to reduce mystery to rational clarity, but to integrate the unknown and the known together in a living whole, in which we are more and more ableto transcend the limitations of our external self....Faith, then, is the only way of opening up the true depths of reality, even of our own reality.
