Using the metaphor of mapmaking, Peter Turchi makes an account of the writer's imaginative work by charting the connections between the verbal and visual arts. Like a good cartographer, Turchi explains without oversimplifying, explores without getting lost. What we're given is a conversation about creativity that preserves the inherent mystery of meaning-making while giving us signposts for finding our way. The book is beautifully designed, to boot.
