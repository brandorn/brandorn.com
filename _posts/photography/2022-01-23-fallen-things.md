description: Exploring the strange drama of detritus.
intro: <p>A few years ago I started taking photos of discarded things I'd find while out on walks with my dog. Odds and ends would catch my eye because, unlike the Chicago suburb where I grew up, Durham is less fastidious about keeping its yards and sidewalks and streets clear of debris. Abandoned cars, school buses, mattresses, toys, dead trees â€” the skeletons of things with histories I'd never know. They intrigued me.</p>

<p>As I took more of these photos, often using film cameras, I began reflecting on my fascination with detritus. I spent time with photos by folks like <a href="https://theincubator.live/2016/11/30/robert-polidori-after-the-flood-large-format-photographs-in-the-aftermath-of-hurricane-katrina/">Robert Polidori</a>, who surveyed New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina, <a href="https://clampart.com/2004/04/dream-collector-30th-anniversary/#thumbnails">Arthur Tress</a>, who has a knack for finding the macabre in the mundane, and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3520">Helen Levitt</a>, whose street scenes of mid-century New York feel at once serendipitous and composed, exuberant and somber. I appreciated how they each draw out the tragedy and comedy of the world around them.</p>

<p>Not quite litter, I came to see discarded objects as kinds of temporary, accidental sculptures. A keyboard nestled in a bed frame, a basketball hoop woven into a pile of birch branches, a doll head placed precariously on the end of a leafless branch. We shape our world with the things we leave behind, for better or worse, but indelibly nonetheless.</p>

<p>I wanted to do something with the photos I'd been taking, so I put together a little book. The result is <i>Fallen Things</i>, a visual meditation on the uncanny, derelict beauty of the mundane world around us. Apart from clearing away a branch or two, none of these images are staged; they're all things I've found while walking around Durham and traveling the south and midwest.</p>

<p>The book is 82 pages, perfect bound and printed locally in Durham on 100lb Mohawk photo paper. A majority of the images were taken on black and white medium format film, which I processed, scanned, and edited. Each copy of the book comes with a little set of birch leaves hand-stamped on the title page, shipped in an eco-friendly compostable mailer.</p>
