      <h1>Prime Climb</h1>
      <p>Prime Climb looks at weather conditions and route characteristics to recommend the best crags for your trip.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="mb-5 medium center">
      <h2 class="mb-0 mt-3">Purpose</h2>
      <p>When planning a rock climbing trip, climbers have a handful of things to consider:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How much time do I have?</li>
        <li>What kind of climbing do I want to do?</li>
        <li>What will the weather be like?</li>
        <li>Whom might I go with?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first two questions – the type of climbing and the time frame for the trip – are the easiest to answer. However, the latter two (determining the weather and finding folks to climb with) require some juggling to determine the feasibility of a trip, which analysis goes something like:</p>

      <table class="ml-1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"><img src="img/pc-x.svg" style="width: 20px;"></td>
            <td>Bad weather</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"><img src="img/pc-x.svg" style="width: 20px;"></td>
            <td>Friends unavailable</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"><img src="img/pc-x.svg" style="width: 20px;"></td>
            <td>Bad weather + friends unavailable</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"><img src="img/pc-x.svg" style="width: 20px;"></td>
            <td>Good weather + friends unavailable</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="pw-0"><img src="img/pc-check.svg" style="width: 20px;"></td>
            <td>Good weather + friends available</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Basic math, yet the actual process of arriving there can be complex. Preliminary user research (i.e. conversation with friends of mine who climb) indicated that climbers typically use some combination of weather reports, climbing location descriptions, and texts or emails between friends to figure out if and where to climb – a task that can be hard to pull off the week before a trip.</p>

      <p><b>Prime Climb</b> aids this decision-making process by combining information about climbing spots with relevant weather reports to recommend ideal climbing locations. In addition to these recommendations, users can indicate whether they plan to climb at a location and can invite friends to join.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-0 mt-3">Audience</h2>
      <p>People who climb outdoors. To make the application appeal to them, it needs to speak their language (without sounding patronizing) and remain straightforward enough to <em>simplify</em> climb planning rather than add another layer of complexity to it. The information needs to be clear, reliable, and easily shared.</p>
      <p>Most of all, however, Prime Climb needs to provide reliable recommendations.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-0 mt-3">Aspects</h2>
      <p>Because it will need to regularly access users' locations and possibly their contacts, Prime Climb will be a mobile app. It will have a few main features:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Climbing locations displayed, along with relevant information (e.g. types of routes, distance from current location, and current weather) and whether the place is climbable for the given time frame.</li>
        <li>Users can indicate whether or not they plan to climb at a certain location.</li>
        <li>Users can invite friends to join a climbing trip.</li>
      </ol>

    </section>

    <section class="mb-5 medium center">
      <h2 class="mb-0 mt-3">Data</h2>
      <p>In order to determine whether to recommend a climbing location, a set of rules need to be written that take into account these variables (and perhaps others):</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Weather conditions</b></li>
          <ul class="ml-1">
            <li>Temperature</li>
            <li>Precipitation / Humidity</li>
            <li>Wind</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Location route characteristics</b></li>
          <ul class="ml-1">
            <li>Relation to sun (i.e. climbing in the sun or shade)</li>
            <li>Protection (e.g. exposed, sheltered, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>

      <p>Generally speaking, the recommendation analysis might look something like this:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>
              <img src="img/pc-climb-on.svg" alt="" style="width: 60px;" class="center">
            </th>
            <th>

            <th>
              <img src="img/pc-no-go.svg" alt="" style="width: 60px;" class="center">
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Hot + Dry + Strong wind + Sheltered</td>
            <td>Cool + Damp + Moderate wind + Sheltered</td>
            <td>Sweltering + Dry + Strong wind + Exposed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Warm + Dry + No wind + Exposed</td>
            <td>Warm + Dry + Strong wind + Exposed</td>
            <td>Cool + Thunderstorms + Sheltered</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cool + Dry + Light wind + Sheltered</td>
            <td>Cold + Dry + Moderate wind + Exposed</td>
            <td>Warm + Moderate rain + Light wind + Exposed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>. . .</td>
            <td>. . .</td>
            <td>. . .</td>
          </tr>

          <p>The date selection is key, since it provides context for Prime Climb's recommendations. By default it will be set to "This weekend," meaning the upcoming weekend. Users will also be able to select other general options, such as "Today," and "Next week," all of which show the specific dates for further clarity.</p>
          <p>For greater flexibility in choosing dates, a granular date selection may make sense. However, beyond a certain time frame (say, two weeks into the future), users would need to be notified that weather predictions are unreliable. A flexible time frame selection would allow users to track weather changes for climbs planned further in advance, which could prove valuable.</p>

      <h2>Further ideas</h2>
      <p class="grey mt--1"><i>Or, What I would have made if I had more time</i></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>A feature that shows who – people inside or outside a user's network – is climbing at certain locations.</b> Users would see a list of their friends and where they are planning to climb, if they are. Users would also see others' names alongside various locations, and be able to message them.</li>
        <li><b>Climbing badges and history.</b> When a person climbs somewhere, they'd be able to save information about their climb which would be visible to others. They'd also see where they climbed and when, which could serve as a useful analytic for the success of the recommendation system. In other words, if they planned to climb somewhere and saved their climb, then the recommendation was accurate.</li>
        <li><b>A useful profile page.</b> Users would be able to determine alert behavior, add locations, and edit information about themselves.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="medium center">
      <h2>Considerations and challenges</h2>

        <li><b>Getting accurate data.</b> The accuracy of the recommendations is important (they are the core of the application), and depends on two things being accurate: the weather predictions, and the characteristics of the climbing routes at certain locations. While weather predictions are increasingly reliable, it may be difficult to find or gather data about climbing conditions. Websites like <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/">The Crag</a> allow climbers to contribute information to a database of locations and routes, which would be useful for the latter type of data. Additionally, if a location doesn't exist yet, Prime Climb would need functionality to allow users to add information about a new place.</li>
        <li><b>Designing the “planning” interaction.</b> Because the recommendations exist for a certain time period (e.g. "today" or "this weekend"), if a user indicates that she is climbing "next weekend," then this indication will reset once the weekend has passed. I would want to make sure that this interaction makes sense, and that the time frame concept makes sense across the entire application. It would help to study how other planning applications solve these problems (e.g. Airbnb, Vamo, Foursquare). The planning feature would need to be flexible but still useful.</li>
        <li><b>Offline functionality.</b> Most outdoor climbing takes place in areas of little-to-no cell receptivity. Prime Climb would need useful offline features for this reason, potentially allowing users to access climb data or upload photos or other information locally before syncing with the application.</li>
