      <hr>

      <p>Application development projects are messy enough – making sure requirements are well-defined, understanding and cataloging requirements, writing and testing functionality – without tools getting in the way. However, as the Systems department in which I work evolved, teams found themselves increasingly burdened by outdated tools that did not suit iterative development practices.</p>

      <p>My team was given a clear directive: create an application that empowers development teams to implement their code. Writing applications is hard; hosting them shouldn’t be.</p>

      <p>As with many projects, I faced a twofold research challenge: learning about our users, and learning about the technology. Without a working knowledge of all of the aspects of application development, I wouldn’t be able to design an interface that served such a technically-minded audience.</p>

      <p>It became evident early on that a well-defined taxonomy was needed for consistency in the application. Studying the development technologies and languages used provided initial hypotheses for clear and useful terms, which were later refined through rounds of card sorts with development teams. These card sorts also provided a basic navigation structure for the application, modeled off the general hierarchy of the hosting platform.</p>

      <p>Wanting to have informal conversations with teams about the design of the application, I used paper prototypes to test various page layout and navigation options with development teams. These discussions challenged assumptions about what development teams actually cared about, and revealed information they commonly regarded as important.</p>

      <p>Once comfortable with a layout and overall page structure, I provided wireframes to my team, which they used to create a beta release of the Cloud Bridge. In-person usability testing revealed design flaws, many of which had to do with form interactions. Given the variety of required user input at various stages of development, challenged us to simplify and clarify the dialog between the application and the user. This dialog is significant – people use the tool every day to do their work – so we wanted to get it right.</p>

      <p>After rounds of beta versions, we released the Cloud Bridge to the development community at large, and continue to iterate in response to feedback and regular in-depth conversations with development teams.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>The Cloud Bridge uses Bootstrap for responsive layout, and follows department brand guidelines. Because the guidelines are not written for development applications, however, I have extended it, writing custom stylesheets (Less CSS) and creating visual assets to fit our needs.</p>

      <p>While I manage all aspects of the user interface, including the language, interaction patterns, HTML, and styling, I work with my team to determine the most efficient way to display information, based on our backend services and data structure. And for complex, JavaScript-intensive interactions, I create wireframes and/or mockups for my team, and write our styles in tandem.</p>
