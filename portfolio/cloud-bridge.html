        <h1>Cloud Bridge</h1>
        <p>A collaborative development tool that enables application development teams across the corporation to efficiently host and manage their code.</p>

        <p class="description">I was asked to lead the redesign of an aging enterprise development tool for a Fortune 500 insurance company. Through rounds of research and testing with primary audiences, my team created a coherent, efficient interface for application hosting.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-1">The project</h2>

          <p>Writing applications is hard; hosting them shouldn’t be. This was my team’s guiding principle for the redesign of a cloud hosting application.</p>

          <p>At the outset of the project, my knowledge of the technical aspects of cloud hosting was scant, which proved to be a blessing. I began by thoroughly researching technology and processes, which involved in-depth conversations product owners and teams in the enterprise. From these I created an information taxonomy, which I later used in card-sorting exercises to determine appropriate categories for the Cloud Bridge’s navigation.</p>

          <p>The original application had a rigid, task-based user interface that forced users into discrete paths. To open the interface and make it easier to navigate, I based the conceptual structure of Cloud Bridge on the structure of the cloud, which developers were already familiar with. Paper prototyping with users early on verified the overall concept the redesign (and shot down a few others). And usability tests with prototypes later in the project helped us refine the navigation and streamline form inputs for the application’s many functions.</p>

          <p>The main challenge of the redesign was how to organize complex, multi-layered sets of information, and make it easy for novice and veteran users alike. Open, regular conversations with development teams throughout the project and frequent testing kept us headed in the right direction.</p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>

          <p>Cloud Bridge is a web application that enables development teams to host their code on an internal cloud. Teams find themselves able to more effectively catch issues, iterate projects, and create production-ready applications.</p>
