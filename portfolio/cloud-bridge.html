      <p>Application development projects are messy enough – making sure requirements are well-defined, understanding and cataloging requirements, writing and testing functionality – without tools getting in the way. However, as the Systems department in which I work evolved, teams found themselves increasingly burdened by outdated tools that didn't suit iterative development practices.</p>

      <p>My team was given a clear directive: create an application that empowers development teams to quickly implement their code. Writing applications is hard; hosting them shouldn’t be.</p>

      <p>As with many projects, I faced a twofold research challenge: learning about our users, and learning about the technology. Without knowledge of users I wouldn't be able to design a tool suited to their perspectives and preferences, and we'd end up recreating the problems we were trying to solve. And without a working knowledge of all of the aspects of application development, I wouldn’t be able to design an interface that served such a technically-minded audience.</p>

      <p>I began by talking with teams of developers to understand how they worked, the frustrations they had with current tools, and ideas that would help them do their work. I also talked with people who weren't developers, but who regularly needed information on development projects. Three basic user types emerged from these conversations. As Jacob Nielsen points out in one of his <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">usability heuristics</a>, applications need to be flexible enough to serve power and general users alike. This became a guiding principle for the design of Cloud Bridge.</p>

      <figure class="double-wide">
        <img src="img/cloud-bridge-users-1.svg" alt="Cloud Bridge's three user types: Doers, Readers, and Admin. ">
        <figcaption>Defining user types by their behavior and experience ensured that we accounted for the range of preferences and use cases.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>It became evident early on that a well-defined taxonomy was needed for consistency in the application. Studying the development technologies and languages led to clear and useful terms, which I later refined through rounds of card sorts with different types of users. These card sorts also provided a basic navigation structure for the application, based on the general hierarchy of the hosting platform itself.</p>

      <figure class="double-wide">
        <img src="img/cloud-bridge-taxonomy-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Cloud Bridge's sitemap and taxonomy.">
        <figcaption>The navigation structure - both the sitemap and taxonomy of the entire application - were influenced by the actual structure of the platform. This helped users understand the infrastructure, avoiding unnecessary abstraction.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="double-wide">
        <img src="img/cloud-bridge-wfs-1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Cloud Bridge required heavy use of wireframes because of the range of functionality requirements provided to our team.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Some initial paper prototypes with annotations from conversations.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Wanting to have informal conversations with teams about the design of the application, I used paper prototypes to test various high-level layout and navigation options. These discussions challenged assumptions I'd held about what development teams actually cared about – seeing other teams' projects, for example, even if related to their own – and revealed information they felt was important.</p>

      <p>Once comfortable with a layout and overall page structure, I made wireframes for my team, which they used to create a beta release of the Cloud Bridge. In-person usability testing revealed design flaws, many of which had to do with form inputs the application. Their feedback challenged me to simplify and clarify the dialog between the application and the user, especially to further minimize repetitive manual entry of form information. This dialog is significant – people use the tool every day to do their work – so we wanted to get it right.</p>

        <figcaption>After the beta release I created mockups to tighten up Cloud Bridge's styling.</figcaption>

        <img src="img/cloud-bridge-modal-1.png" alt="Screenshot of a modal dialog.">
        <figcaption>Modals are used extensively, since they provide a flexible way for receiving form input from users while preserving navigation context.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The main challenge of designing Cloud Bridge consisted in organizing complex, multi-layered sets of information, and making it easily accessible to a range of users. I achieved this through open conversations with my development team, who helped me understand the infrastructure and the possibilities and limits of the data we had to work with.</p>

      <p>After rounds of beta versions, we released the Cloud Bridge to the development community at large, and continue to iterate in response to feedback and regular in-depth conversations with development teams.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>The Cloud Bridge uses Bootstrap for responsive layout, and follows department brand guidelines. Because the guidelines are not written for development applications, however, I have extended it, writing custom stylesheets (Less CSS) and creating visual assets to fit our needs.</p>

      <p>I manage all aspects of the user interface, including the language, interaction patterns, HTML, and styling. When creating complex, data-intensive interactions, I work with my team to determine the most efficient way to load and display information based on our backend services and data structure. And for complex, JavaScript-intensive interactions, I typically create wireframes and/or mockups for my team, and write our styles in tandem.</p>
