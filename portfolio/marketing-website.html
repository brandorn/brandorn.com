          <p>Help development teams and leadership understand the value of a modern PaaS offering, and explain they can use the framework and infrastructure to its full potential.</p>

        <div class="grid__col grid__col--1-of-2">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Despite piles of documentation in various internal and external wikis, we found that development teams don’t know why to shift to the new PaaS, or where to start learning when they do. The short run-challenges of migration distracted from the long-run benefits.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive resource that earns teams’ trust by providing reliable information, pointing to relevant documentation, and speaking with them in a straightforward way.</p>

        <div class="grid__col grid__col--1-of-2">
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>The leap from moving to the PaaS is made less intimidating by providing teams a meaningful, uncomplicated introduction to the various aspects of the development frameworks and infrastructure they’ll be working with.</p>

      <p>Inertia isn’t an uncommon characteristic of large corporations. Even if various teams or areas are working to follow industry standards in their work, other parts of the organization may not understand why or how to do things better.</p>

      <p>The area in which I work was formed to develop and maintain a modern cloud hosting infrastructure for the Systems department. We use open source technology as part of an effort to modernize the way in which applications are written and maintained. A year after the PaaS product was completed, our area had written plenty documentation for teams. However, the purpose and benefits of the approach of our service was being lost in the rigmarole of working to get teams up to speed – teams that weren’t sure where to start.</p>

      <p>I was asked to work with a team of consultants to design a website that would encourage use of the PaaS, to be used as part of the on-boarding process and in conversations among leadership. Essentially, my team needed to find a way to help teams overcome the inertia of outdated development philosophies.</p>

      <p>Early on, it became clear that the value of this website would be twofold: one, explaining the <em>whys</em> of the PaaS approach, and two, explaining the <em>hows</em> to development teams, the folks using the offering day in and day out. It was as much philosophical as it was instructional. My teammates and I identified and interviewed groups of people involved in various ways with application development: architects, project planners, team leads, and developers. Rounds of conversations uncovered common questions, concerns, and frustrations. These themes – things like intimidation at the learning curve for the technology, or  the newness of the approach – informed both the information architecture and content strategy of the website. We learned what was most important to them early on in their use of the PaaS – information that was often buried in scattered documents.</p>

      <p>We ended up writing the benefits and guidance according to what our users were interested in, rather than what our area thought was best to tell them. A strategic concept based on the value of modernized infrastructure and frameworks for the department became the guiding principle for the site’s content, which would be written with an approachable, reliable, and intelligent tone.</p>

        <figcaption>For this project, wireframing also helped the team conceptualize the navigation structure, and discuss it with stakeholders.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="clear">Having established types of content for the website, I created a set of wireframes to show various ways to arrange and navigate between pieces of information. I then iterated these wireframes based on feedback and discussions within our area. With refined page layouts and navigation structure, I worked with a developer to write the website in AngularJS and implement an enterprise CMS, using Bootstrap for responsiveness and custom stylesheets to correspond with brand standards. Style tiles came in handy during conversations with product owners when determining the site's overall aesthetic.</p>

        <figcaption>Elements, colors, and other aspects of the site were addressed early on.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="clear">With regard to the website's content, I wrote the strategy and benefit statements for the main pages, and helped with technical writing and copy editing for others. I also created a content outline for our team to use when working with various subject matter experts to gather appropriate and relevant information on more technical topics. And though I’m not an illustrator, I felt that custom illustrations would give the pages a more approachable tone, so gave some vector illustrations a go. A little whimsy never hurts.</p>
