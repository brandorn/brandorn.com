        <h2 class="mt-1">The project</h2>

        <p>Whether an application is running or not is relatively easy to tell. But how <em>well</em> it’s running – how efficient and stable it is – can be a more difficult but equally important judgment. To that end, I helped an analytics team create Insight, a development tool that simplifies application monitoring for development teams.</p>

        <p>Web applications are typically composed of numerous components which provide discrete pieces of functionality. Studying the way teams used logging and diagnostic tools showed that it was difficult for them to get a sense of application performance without running complex, cumbersome queries on these granular components. Insight’s value, then, would be to make key measurements easily accessible for the applications and components that teams were interested in.</p>

        <p>After learning about application infrastructure and relevant measurements, I created an information taxonomy to catalog each piece of information Insight would display. From there, I put my Tufte hat on and tried out various ways of displaying data, testing options with users through paper sketches and browser prototypes.</p>

        <p>The main challenge of making Insight was designing a clean navigation system that allowed users to find those components that they were interested in among the thousands of components. I collaborated with my development team to create a navigation that includes search, filtering, sorting, and tagging, all of which correspond to how the developers think about their components. And after trying various table and grid layouts, we used tiles to represent high-level information about components, from which “drawers” expanded to show more detailed metrics. As the number of metrics reported grew, however, we ended up keeping the tiles but dropping the drawers, as it were, instead using full-page modals to display detailed metrics.</p>

        <h3>Impact</h3>

        <p>Application teams can quickly compare metrics against norms and diagnose issues by correlating trends among key metrics.</p>
