          <h3>The project</h3>
          
          <p>I worked with an analytics team to create a straightforward dashboard that displays performance metrics for customer web applications. Various sources of enterprise reporting were leading to inconsistent judgments about these applications, so teams and leaders wanted a consolidated, authoritative, and accessible source for key metrics.</p>

          <p>I began by learning about performance standards that the department had established, and how these applied to the key web applications. Interviews with development teams and executives revealed that they cared less about the granular details of an application over time, and more about whether targets were being met. Knowing that it was important to keep the targets as a reference point, I designed a table layout that displays the status of applications for the current week and allows users to pan to previous weeks. For those who want to see longer-term trends, application-specific pages show data from the past twelve months.</p>

          <p>The System Status Dashboard sticks closely to the definition of a dashboard - an interface in which the layout remains constant while the data changes. Detailed information is quickly available, yet is not crowded onto the page. I enjoy working on dashboards because they demand the limitation of “non-data ink.” I strive to create interfaces that gracefully achieve this kind of intensity through logical information hierarchy, visual rhythm, nuanced alerts, and clear language.</p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>

          <p>Teams across the enterprise have a consolidated, reliable means for understanding application performance, helping them understand impacts and track performance changes over time.</p>
