          <p>A straightforward, mobile-friendly interface that displays application status information based on agreed-upon standards.</p>

          <p>General audiences have a consolidated, scalable, and reliable means for understanding current and past application performance, enabling them to make better-informed decisions for their applications.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>In large corporations, the people making decisions are often far removed from the people doing the work. The generals are distanced from the front line. However, open channels of communication are required if development teams and their leadership are to understand if their application is running as expected. In this instance, the disconnect between teams and department leaders was causing conflicting, telephone game-esque reports about the runtime performance of business applications.</p>

      <p>I was asked to work with a team of database and Java developers to create a consolidated view of business-critical application health. The audience was people involved in coordinating and making sense of the various areas and applications across the Systems department. Previous attempts had been made to display this type of information, yet often resulted in illegible visualizations that didn’t provide management or teams with useful data. Clarity and consistency were our guiding principles from the start.</p>

      <p>Dashboards are quickly readable because their layout remains constant while the displayed data varies. When designing the homepage, it was important to establish clear visual conventions: meaningful icons, a consistent timeframe, and easy access to detailed information. The choice of a table wasn't difficult, yet finding a way to display detailed impact information – outage timeframes, teams' comments, and related information – took some experimentation. I ended up using modal dialogs to reveal this secondary data, and created application-specific pages for showing metrics across timeframes longer than those on the dashboard display.</p>

      <figure class="to-the-right">
        <img src="img/ssd-icons.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>After various revisions, I created on set of simple, accessible icons that support at-a-glance interpretations.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Because the metrics being reported and the standards used were relatively straightforward, the main challenge of the project was to find ways to indicate impacts of varying levels of significance, and to show trends over time. After rounds of user interviews, I drew paper sketches to share concepts with my team and product owner, which evolved into mockups that we discussed with various stakeholders. I used mockups instead of lower-fidelity wireframes, since we mainly wanted user feedback on layout and the clarity of the icons in the context of the dashboard.</p>

      <p>I then made a series of browser prototypes to further experiment with alternative navigation structures, namely how to move between overview and detail screens...</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Apart from user research and visual design, I created HTML prototypes using Bootstrap, jQuery, and custom stylesheets. These prototypes allowed me to receive useful feedback from my team team and our users, and iterate accordingly. We also tested page load and visual display on tablets, knowing that it would likely be the device-of-choice for folks viewing the data.</p>
