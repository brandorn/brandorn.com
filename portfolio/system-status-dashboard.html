      <p>In large corporations, the people making decisions are often far removed from the people doing the work. The generals are distanced from the front line. However, open channels of communication are required if development teams and their leadership are to understand if their application is running as expected. In this instance, the disconnect between teams and department leaders was causing conflicting, telephone-game-esque reports about the runtime performance of business applications.</p>

      <p>For this project, I was asked to work with a team of database and Java developers to create a consolidated view of business-critical application health. The audience for the dashboard was people involved in coordinating and making sense of the various areas and applications across the Systems department. Previous attempts had been made to consolidate this type of information, yet often resulted in illegible visualizations that didn’t provide management or teams with useful data. Clarity and consistency were our guiding principles from the start.</p>

      <p>Because the metrics being reported and the standards used were relatively straightforward, the main challenge of the project was to find ways to indicate disruptions of varying levels of significance, and to show trends over time. After rounds of user interviews, I drew paper sketches to share concepts with my team and product owner, which evolved into wireframes which we discussed with various leaders. These conversations exposed assumptions that I hadn’t considered – that people would like to know the various moving parts within an application, for example.</p>

      <p>Dashboards are quickly readable because their layout remains constant while the displayed data varies. When designing the homepage, it was important to establish clear visual conventions: meaningful icons, a consistent timeframe, and easy access to detailed information. The choice of a table wasn't difficult, yet finding a way to display detailed impact information – outage timeframes, teams' comments, and related information – took some experimentation. I ended up using modal dialogs to reveal this secondary data, and created application-specific pages for showing metrics across timeframes longer than those on the dashboard display.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Apart from user research and visual design, I created an HTML prototype using Bootstrap and custom stylesheets. We were able to use the prototype to receive feedback from user groups before implementing the backend services, and it made for a cleaner handoff between myself and the developers on the team. We also tested page load and visual display on tablets, knowing that it would likely be the device-of-choice for folks viewing the data. Also, I designed recognizable, accessible icons that inform without shouting – a pitfall of many dashboards.</p>
