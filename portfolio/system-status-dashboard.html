      <p>In large corporations, the people making strategic decisions are often far removed from the people doing the work. The generals are distanced from the front line. However, open channels of communication are required if development teams and their leadership are to understand if their application is running as expected. In this instance, the disconnect between teams and department leaders was causing conflicting, telephone game-esque reports about the runtime performance of business applications.</p>

      <p>I was asked to work with a data team to create a consolidated view of business-critical application health. The audience was people who lead various areas and applications across the Systems department. Previous attempts had been made to display this type of information, yet often resulted in illegible visualizations that didn’t provide management or teams with useful data. Clarity and consistency were our guiding principles from the start.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The main challenge of the project was to find ways of displaying impacts of varying levels of significance and providing quick access to detailed impact statements and trended data. When designing the home page, it was important to establish clear visual conventions: meaningful icons, a consistent timeframe, and easy access to detailed information. Sticking to the theoretical definiton of a dashboard –  an interface in which the layout remains constant while the displayed data changes – I needed to keep summary health information visible and accessible, while still allowing users to dig more deeply if they were curious about an application or issue.</p>

      <figure class="to-the-right">
        <img src="img/ssd-sketch-1.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>One of a few initial paper sketches of the dashboard, used as a conversation piece among the team and our stakeholders.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Rounds of user interviews helped identify users' preferences for the data, which I applied when drawing paper sketches to share concepts with my team. which evolved into mockups that we discussed with various stakeholders. The choice of a table wasn't difficult, yet finding a way to display detailed impact information – outage timeframes, teams' comments, and related information – took some experimentation. I ended up using modal dialogs to reveal this secondary data, and created application-specific pages for showing metrics across timeframes longer than those on the dashboard display.</p>

        <figcaption>Example of an application-specific page, displaying data trended over a period of time.</figcaption>

      <figure class="to-the-right">
        <img src="img/ssd-icons.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>After various revisions, I created a set of simple, accessible icons that support at-a-glance interpretations of data.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>For this project, I chose to make mockups instead of lower-fidelity wireframes, since we mainly wanted users' feedback on the clarity of information displayed in the context of the dashboard interface. In particular, I needed to make sure the icons conveyed their intended meaning. Initially I didn't want anything to display in a table cell if an application was healthy that day, following the idea that no news is good news when it comes to app health. However, we found out that users took this to mean that data didn't exist for the day. So I made icons that that avoid making the app too red-and-green Christmasy, and seem to strike a good balance between clarity and subtlety.</p>

      <p>After revising the mockups some, including requisite admin functionality, I created a series of browser prototypes to further experiment with alternative navigation structures, namely how to move between overview and detail screens. These prototypes gave users a chance to click through pages and see how the dashboard felt on a tablet (it felt pretty good).</p>

      <p class="clear">My role in the project consisted of user research, visual design, and interface prototyping with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. Since the initial release, we've built further administrative features into the System Status Dashboard, and have expanded the breadth of applications on which it reports. The lightweight UI has scaled nicely, with minimal growing pains.</p>

      <p>I enjoy working on dashboards because they demand the limitation of "non-data ink." Each pixel either serves the data or distracts from it. I strive to create interfaces that gracefully achieve this kind of intensity through logical information hierarchy, visual rhythm, relevant alerts, and clear language. </p>
