        <p class="description">A website that introduces people to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) product by showcasing benefits, describing an open source technical stack, and consolidating useful documentation.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>

          <p>To speed up development lifecycles and improve application stability, a Fortune 500 insurance company developed an internal cloud platform using open source technologies for its customer applications. I was brought in to help the Systems marketing team research and design a solution that increased adoption by demonstrating benefits and pointing people toward helpful resources.</p>

          <p>My first step was to lead a series of interviews with people from around the Systems department to understand the challenges they faced when developing for the new platform – teams and managers alike. These conversations helped us identify a series of common frustrations, which later became the focus of the website’s content strategy.</p>

          <p>I knew that part of the website’s purpose was simply to earn people’s trust. The needed to be approachable, benevolent, and straightforward, which became the principles for the content and design. Style tiles came in handy during conversations with product owners when determining the site’s overall aesthetic. The website’s other purpose was to help development teams find reliable documentation when learning how to use the platform, so I created a content outline for the marketing team to use when meeting with product teams and creating content.</p>

          <p>This project reminded me that education must be marketed, and that marketing can be educational. The two disciplines complement each other when thoughtfully combined.</p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>

          <p>The leap from moving to the modern platform is made less intimidating through a meaningful articulation of overall benefits and uncomplicated introductions to relevant products.</p>
