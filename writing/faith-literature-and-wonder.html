        <h1>Faith, Literature, and Wonder</h1>
        <p>28 November 2014</p>
        <p>Brief thoughts on the intersection of three preoccupations.</p>
        
      </header>


      <p>I grew up in a quiet suburb of Chicago, where my family lived a few blocks from the library and even closer to our Methodist church. Many of my childhood memories concern one of the two: summer reading lists were paired with vacation bible school, hours spent studying with weekly youth group meetings in people’s houses or at church. As I matured as a person of thought and a person of faith, my passion for literature and for the things of God grew simultaneously, albeit separately, like trees in different parts of a forest separated by foliage and fog.</p>

      <p>Distinct as these experiences were, I began to sense the similarity of literature and faith in high school. It occurred to me that each exist to help us find our way in the world, addressing fundamental questions that take up permanent residence in our lives. Who are we? Why are we here? What are we supposed to do? I felt these questions acutely at that age, which is when I began reading CS Lewis. In his writing I discovered the possibility of reconciling the truth of the religious and literary realms. Lewis showed me that living by faith involves the active engagement of one’s imagination: with Scripture, that our minds might be renewed, but also with those authors whose words quicken our senses to a keener perception of reality. At that time of my life I also attended Young Life, through which I had a mentor who introduced me to the concept of wonder and its theological implications. He understood art to be rife with holiness, presenting us with moments of clear-eyed grace for seeing ourselves, others, and God. Thus began my preoccupation with the connections between art and belief, wonder and faith.</p>

      <p>In college, I learned that Blake capitalized “imagination” in his poems, understanding it to be a sacred faculty bestowed on us that we might see with eyes greater than our own. What religious experiences I consider myself to have had have come when a theological concept I rationally held to be true was inspired with imaginative life. Grace, sanctification, hope - terms I learned reading Scripture and hearing sermons suddenly illuminated with vision at once my own and not my own. Literature has helped me develop a sensitivity to the unseen realities involved in being human; church, Scripture, and theologians have put names to the unseen realities that comprehend human experience.</p>

      <p>I'm curious about the relationship between reading literature and living a believing life, because I am curious about what Christ meant when he promised us life to the full. And it seems that authentic life has something to do with what literature and theology share in common – an imaginative vision of people, history, life, death, etc. I read authors who write with literary and spiritual conviction – people I would consider among the Christian humanists. People like CS Lewis, Marilynne Robinson, Annie Dillard, Frederich Buechner, Wendell Berry, and Eugene Peterson. Authors who believe fully in the immanence and transcendence of God, and who attest to “human theomorphism,” to use Robinson’s apt phrase. The posture of wonder common to all these authors, their imaginative belief, runs like a shimmering thread through my bookshelves.</p>

      <p>I am interested in wonder because, for the most part, I do not feel the believers and non-believers are looking for answers to their questions about existence. Instead, they are looking for the kind of vision that comprehends their experience. At the end of the film <em>American Beauty</em>, Lester reflects, “I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me… but it’s hard to stay mad, when there’s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once, and it’s too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to burst.” His vision of joy comprehends his experience of pain. When Jesus said that we must become like little children to inherit the kingdom, He invited us to accept a reality at once part and above what we take to be real. He invited us lives of authentic wonder.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>I sense an essential interdependence of wonder and faith, particularly in the relationship between religion and literature. Many have argued that wonder can be had without religious belief. The contemporary church in North America tacitly argues that religious belief can be had apart from any meaningful cultivation of wonder. And I have worked in the technology and design world long enough to know the emptiness of what typically passes for “wonderful.” The same can often be said for my church experience. So I want to explore the relationship between belief and wonder, with the hypothesis that they are inseparable and mutually affirming.</p>

      <p>Having studied English literature at home and abroad, my theological convictions have been naturally shaped by my literary ones. I am intrigued by the insight that reality cannot be fully accounted for by reason and observation alone (the epistemological faculties our culture holds in highest regard). The imagination is indispensable and unavoidable. Literature is an enactment of the conviction that we live by faith and not by sight.</p>

      <p>Although I admire fiction with clear religious themes (especially that of Marilynne Robinson and Flannery O’Connor), I read widely, with ears attentive to revelation in all its forms. Broadly put, I am curious about how literature cultivates wonder, and what wonder means for belief. The theologians I admire mostly wrote during the 20th and 21st centuries, some of whom write directly or tangentially on wonder - authors such as C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Paul Tillich, Richard Niebuhr, and Eugene Peterson. These are thinkers who responded to modern notions and experiences of pain, community life, technology, and faith.</p>

      <p>Lori Branch argues the act of scholarship, even literary criticism, can approach the act of prayer. As she puts it, “What does it mean to read and write lovingly?… It is entirely possible and, I would say, desirable to read literature lovingly, with others or by oneself, and to write in a loving way: patiently, kindly, humbly, cherishing hope and goodness.”<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> What ambitions I have for my own writing, thinking, designing, and believing are eloquently outlined for me in her adaptation of Paul’s catalog.</p>
