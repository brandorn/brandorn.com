      <h1>Burnetticisms</h1>
      <p>28 June 2014</p>
      <p>Back in the day I worked in advertising as a brand strategist at Leo Burnett. The ad agency was founded by its namesake, who was a Midwestern man of wit and heart. Here are some of his phrases that have helped me keep my head on straight in the business world.</p>

    <blockquote class="mb-5 mt-5">"Cling like wildcats to the only realities we can swear we have hold of – our own sacred and individual integrities."</blockquote>

    <p class="mb-3">"In a world where nobody seems to know what's going to happen next, the only thing to do to keep from going completely nuts from frustration is plain old-fashioned work."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"Curiosity about life in all its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"Collective solutions to problems start with individual human beings and individual efforts."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"I like to look on our own shop as a kind of barefoot agency which is mentally always trying to put itself into other people's shoes – a working ranch rather than a dude ranch."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"Steep yourself in your subject, work like hell, and love, honor, and obey your hunches."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"I have learned to practice what I call 'creative dissatisfaction.'"</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"To swear off making mistakes is very easy. All you have to do is swear off having ideas."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"It's important in building our organizational machines not to exclude the dissenter, the 'Outsider,' the nonconformist."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"Kep it simple. Let's do the obvious thing – the common thing – but let's do it uncommonly well."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"A really good creative person is more interested in eartnestness than in glibness and takes more satisfaction out of converting people than in 'wowing' them."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"The grist for our mill is still words. Words as they put the sock and soul into the expression of an idea."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"A real idea has a power of its own and a life of its own."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"In learning to work and live with people, the most important thing I am coming to understand is the simple truth that 'no one makes mistakes on purpose.' Knowing this should allow us to concentrate on correcting the mistake rather than making life miserable for the mistake maker. If he is the right sort, nothing you can say or do to him will make him feel any worse about the mistake than he does already."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"This is as good a time as any to start examining ourselves for any of those tell-tale signs of success that lead to inner rot. Those signs are complacency...coasting...bureaucracy."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"In this agency business we are people talking to people, and that's what we should keep running through our fingers."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"Promises must be kept, deadlines met, commitments honored; not just for the sake of old-fashioned morality, but because we become what we do (or fail to do), and character is simply the sum of our performances."</p>

    <p class="mb-3">"When a man knows deep in his bones what is right, and keeps acting on it, he avoids the trap of compromise – he remains incorruptible."</p>
