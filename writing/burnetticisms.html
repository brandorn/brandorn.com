        <p>28 June 2014</p>
        <p>Back in the day I worked in advertising as a brand strategist at Leo Burnett. The ad agency was founded by its namesake, who was a Midwestern man of heart and wit. Here are some of his phrases that have helped me keep my head on straight in the business world.</p>

      <blockquote>"Cling like wildcats to the only realities we can swear we have hold of – our own sacred and individual integrities."</blockquote>

      <p>"I like to look on our own shop as a kind of barefoot agency which is mentally always trying to put itself into other people's shoes – a working ranch rather than a dude ranch."</p>

      <p>"I have learned to practice what I call 'creative dissatisfaction.'"</p>

      <p>"It's important in building our organizational machines not to exclude the dissenter, the 'Outsider,' the nonconformist."</p>

      <p>"The grist for our mill is still words. Words as they put the sock and soul into the expression of an idea."</p>

      <p>"In learning to work and live with people, the most important thing I am coming to understand is the simple truth that 'no one makes mistakes on purpose.' Knowing this should allow us to concentrate on correcting the mistake rather than making life miserable for the mistake maker. If he is the right sort, nothing you can say or do to him will make him feel any worse about the mistake than he does already."</p>

      <p>"This is as good a time as any to start examining ourselves for any of those tell-tale signs of success that lead to inner rot. Those signs are complacency...coasting...bureaucracy."</p>

      <p>"Promises must be kept, deadlines met, commitments honored; not just for the sake of old-fashioned morality, but because we become what we do (or fail to do), and character is simply the sum of our performances."</p>

      <p>"Steep yourself in your subject, work like hell, and love, honor, and obey your hunches."</p>
