										<h1>On <i>Liberal Art</i></h1>

								<p>I created this website because I needed a place to sort out my thoughts. <i>Liberal Art</i> is a collection of ideas, questions, and work about design, art, and belief. I often think and read about these three things, yet don't often find them discussed in relation to one another. So, this is an in-between project, an exploration of resonances, contrasts, connections, and possibilities.</p>
								
								<p><i>Liberal Art</i> doesn't refer to politics nor academics. Before it meant "politically progressive," <i>liberal</i> conveyed a sense of openness to others and to life. It carried connotations of generosity, munificence, and affirmation. Its etymologic root is the Sanskrit <i>lubh</i>, which became the Germanic <i>lieb</i>, from which we get liberty, belief, and love<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. Thus the word has to do with those attitudes and actions which affirm our dignity, implying a grace that overcomes stinginess, cynicism, smallness of mind. It also implies a risk taken in hope of greater well being - the risk of open-handedness, or of turning one's cheek. This kind of empathetic, wide-ranging openness was the ideal for which our liberal arts schools were created. It is Whitman's democratic ideal for culture; it is the positive articulation of the vaguely negative term <i>tolerance</i>.</p>
								
								<p>I'm interested in art and design and belief that has the character of liberality because I believe that this quality is what gives us dignity and dignifies others. It's a quality, and may be a useful standard. Liberal art is anything we create that respects the mystery inherent in people and things; it represents reality without reducing it, creating form out of ambiguity while preserving the vitality of ambiguity. It is work and thought sufficient to the subject and respectful of the audience. Liberal art is harmonious with life as it's lived.</p>
								
								<p>Design, art, and belief. These terms require some defining. Here are some notions in short:</p>
								
								<blockquote>Design, because the things we make &mdash; art, tools, clothing, literature &mdash; carry and preserve our values. Our lives are literally and figuratively shaped by our things. We shape them, they shape us. Our things have a role in making us human.</blockquote>
								
								<blockquote>Wonder, because I'm convinced that the essential, ubiquitous childhood experience of newness and awe contains in it the essence of life for which we long. Wonder attunes us to the fullness of life; to experience wonder is to experience fullness of life.</blockquote>
								
								<blockquote>And belief, because these are ultimately religious questions being asked, about purpose, dignity, and hope, so it is through religion that they may be adequately addressed, to the extent that they can be. I don't mean that questions of human dignity need be answered, even discussed in religious terms, but that their essential religious basis deserves our attention.</blockquote>
								
								<p>Description</p>
								
								<hr>
								
								<p>My thinking on these topics has been shaped by my studies (in English literature and Economics), by my work as a User Experience designer, and by books I have read by authors similarly concerned. My intent for the project is not to rehash their arguments and observations, but to build on their insights &mdash; also to reconcile these seemingly disparate spheres of life that I have experienced. For the past three or four years I have kept two types of journals: one containing notes and reflections on my design work, and the other containing my notes and reflections on all else in life. One is mainly about work and how to do good work, the other about life and how to live a good life. Slowly, the two have come to resemble one another as I've recognized the inseparability of work and life. This project is influenced by the resonances I have discovered and hope to discover.</p>

								<p>The ultimate act of liberality, the highest liberal art, is depicted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God gives life to Adam. God's risk is evident in Adam's nonchalance, lazily extending his hand to God's exuberant, angel-accompanied charge. Would he recognize what was being given to him? What would he do with it? There are shadows in both of their palms. Yet the risk's reward is evident in the mirroring of their hands: God's hand level with Adam's, the blessing of human theomorphism, to use Marilynne Robinson's apt phrase<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Creator creating dignity, man receiving dignity. Man imaged as God. With his work, Michaelangelo does justice to this highest liberal art, imagining and representing it in all its force and ambiguity and wonder.</p>
								
								<p>The painting provides the context for this project and the questions it asks: What do our lives mean? What are we to make of them? How do we live and make and believe in a way appropriate to our worth? Like all dignifying art, the painting answers not by telling, but by pointing.</p>
