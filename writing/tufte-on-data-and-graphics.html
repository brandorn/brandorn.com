      <h2 class="mb-0">Presenting Data and Information</h2>
      <p class="small-type grey text-center">Chicago, IL &middot; 20 August 2013</p>

      <p>Design cannot fix an information problem. By then it's too late. "Often the best that design can do is get out of the way." If design calls attention to itself, it has failed. "Good information design is endlessly self-effacing." The design isn't the point; the content is. Don't "go meta" in your design.</p>

      <p>"The design principle should reflect the cognitive task." Design approaches and conventions should assist the reader's thinking about the content, not get in the way of it.</p>

      <p>Sentences are our tools of thought.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It's OK, even good, to show data this way. People form their own sentences about data when tying to understand them, so consider how to aid this kind of thinking. "Don't exchange sentences for bullet-point grunts."</p>

      <p>Visualizations should mirror the way the content exists in reality. This is the truth of the Internet: it connects things that are actually connected. The world is an ecosystem of connections. Like Jonathan Corum <a href="http://style.org/tapestry/">points out</a>, a visualization has failed if its content can be substituted with something entirely irrelevant and still make sense ("respect the data," he exhorts).</p>

      <p>Begin staff meetings with a document and study hall. Forget PowerPoint decks. Let people read at their own pace, focusing on items they care about and actually thinking about the content at hand. Discuss points as necessary, answer questions, and end early. Leave something comprehensible for those who didn't attend. "That's how Amazon does it, and they're doing pretty well." I've done this, and it feels strange at first, mostly because we're accustomed to noise and distraction, and silence expects focus.</p>

      <p>Make presentations in the browser. Include links to other materials relevant to the presentation, as well as links to the source data. Use NYT articles as a standard. What you're after is legibility and flexibility. Create presentations flexible enough for people to interact with in their own cognitive style. Let them scan, jump around, read linearly, whatever.</p>

      <p>Be scrappy when researching. "Loot," to use Tufte's term. Learn what you need to know with inventive resourcefulness, with a kind of "hacker curiosity." "Do whatever it takes." This kind of approach eliminates superfluities in one's work. Do real investigative work, not settling for the "data of convenience."</p>

      <p>"Annotate everything, especially linking lines. Get to the verb." See Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html">Proposal for a new "Information Management" system</a>.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Linking lines are the verbs, and they show the connections.</p>

      <p>In any diagram, the metaphor and standard is the map. The <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003vq">Swiss mountain maps</a> are our best model. Google Maps is the most-viewed diagram in the world. Study it â€“ its use of color, type, iconography, grid, layout, scaling, etc. Every diagram we make should be as easily comprehended.</p>

      <p>Because of the massive amount of information, its import, and the scant amount of space in which to present it, the best data visualizations today are found in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>

      <p>The problem with displays is that they're flat, and the world is many-dimensioned. "Any time you can present a real, three-dimensional thing, do so." This is the value of 3D printing. The best design faithfully represents the fullness of the content.</p>

      <p>The most important thing about understanding one's audience isn't knowing the audience but knowing the <em>content</em>. "Don't go meta. Don't be preoccupied with your technique. Don't talk about yourself." I'm reminded of Marilynne Robinson's though on teaching: "I don't try to teach technique because, frankly, most technical problems go away when a writer realizes where the life of a story lies."</p>

      <p>More than know your audience, <em>respect</em> your audience. "It's wonderful that people showed up." And don't understimate their intelligence. "Your job is to make everbody smart."</p>

      <p>The best and only test of an application (of anything, really) is its performance in the wild. This is why the design Google's, Amazon's, Github's, and other longstanding web agencies epitomize the best design: they've withstood and been shaped by the test of broad use. Therefore, look to these kinds of applications for design standards and conventions. "Play in the big leagues. Compare your work with theirs." Learn from them what works and what doesn't. Emulating their principles, which is different from mimicking their design.</p>

      <p>Tufte's humor, temper, and pacing of speech reminds me of Garrison Keillor and, perhaps surprisingly for an east coast professor, like Keillor he has an unpretentious and beneficent demeanor. He doesn't present for the sake of intellectual posturing, nor to assert his credibility by condemning the poor work of others. He was interested only in showing people a better way of doing things and simply taught. He didn't talk much about himself; he didn't "go meta." The presentation wasn't about him, so he didn't make it about himself.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-0">The Thinking Eye</h2>
      <p class="small-type grey text-center">Champaign, IL &middot; 30 April 2014</p>

      <blockquote>"To see with fresh different eyes: stay in the optical experience, forget the name of what one sees, defamiliarize, see with laughing eyes, construct parodies, shut up and look, see with an open mind but not an empty head, see to learn not to confirm.</blockquote>

      <p>"Once you have a point of view, all of your seeing will back you up."<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>  The designer's task, then, is to go about her work with beginner eyes. What's the visual equivalent of a palette cleanser?</p>

      <p>The more subtle the object being considered, the more that words will deform the view. "Conversation is usually a catastrophe for seeing." Words shape seeing, for better or worse. I don't agree with Tufte that conversation necessarily erodes seeing, however. Influence is amoral: it can help, or it can hurt.</p>

      <p>"To see with fresh eyes, with an open mind, requires the deliberate act of remaining in the optical moment."</p>

      <p>"I decided to wage the war on stupidity locally, by consulting, then globally, by writing and teaching." Most any kind of work consists in helping people to see and think more clearly.</p>

      <p>"The rage to conclude needs to be countered by the rage to produce." A variant of Flaubert's "THe rage for wanting to conclude is one of the most deadly and most fruitless manias to befall humanity..."</p>

      <p>"Serenity is a condition under which all brainpower is devoted to the thinking eye. Create environments of serenity."</p>

      <p>"Silence shapes and deepens seeing." True seeing, like true listening, involves an emptying of the self. We have to forget about ourselves, forget about our ideas and categories and past understandings in order to be present to what, or whom, is before us.</p>

      <p>"Looting is looking for what's important to one's own work, not letting a project or discipline determine that for you." I see this a kind of liberal scrappiness, epitomized visually by the collage, verbally by the essay.</p>

      <p>"The thinking eye must have a taste for excellence regardless of the field." </p>

      <p>"Do forever knowledge. Play in the big leagues. Do the long horizon, if you can.... Public health is long horizon, unlike the greedy social science of Silicon Valley." Although he didn't say it, I gather that "forever work" is the work of selflessly serving people, regardless of the medium, role, project, etc.</p>

      <p>"You can have your own point of view, but not your own facts" (Daniel Patrick Moynihan).</p>

      <p>"If you torture data long enough, it will confess to anything." So, listen to the data.</p>
