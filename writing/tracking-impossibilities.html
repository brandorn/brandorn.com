      <h1>Tracking Impossibilities: On the Irony of Life Tracking</h1>
      <p>15 April 2013</p>
      <p>The risk we run when when putting numbers to subjective, unmeasurable things.</p>
    </header>

    <p>In March of 2013, <a href="http://feltron.com/">Nicholas Felton</a> released his eighth consecutive Annual Report, continuing to take to the literal extreme the Psalmist’s exhortation to “number thy days.” Each report is a compendium of statistics from the year in the life of Felton – facts, information, and data self-collected and exquisitely charted in his now-famous publications. Where he was each day. Who he was with. What he did. How long he slept. What he drank. His work is numerical lepidoptery of a sort, an attempt to capture and represent the “invisible stories all around us” as he put it in a 2011 interview with Fast Company.</p>

    <p>Having followed Felton’s reports the past few years, I’m struck by an irony that haunts his work, and that haunts our culture’s obsession with life tracking in general. The irony is the attempt to quantify the unquantifiable, to use the impersonal to reveal the personal. Although Felton’s work exhibits a healthy sense of this irony (e.g. non-sequiturs like his addition of miles traveled in Grand Theft Auto 3 to total miles traveled in 2008) – I find this self-awareness lacking in life-tracking gurus like Tim Ferris. Nevertheless, it is a troubling irony.</p>

    <p>Life tracking, the storing of personal statistics to discover otherwise-hidden patterns, results from the collision of two cultural movements: the proliferation of data-collecting technologies, and our impulse to find meaning in individualism rather than through relationships. The purposes and moralities of nations, organizations, or religions repulse us, so we look to our individual lives for meaning. And, unsure about the validity of any purposes or moralities over and above our individual lives, we find comfort in the recorded clarity of having drank three cups of coffee on Tuesday, or having slept 7.38 hours last night.</p>

    <p>Unlike some, I don’t despise Felton’s work because of his meticulously-kept metadata. It’s no more obsessive than those who check their email on their phones every two hours. What troubles me about his Annual Reports, however, is that their irony seems to be fading, or, rather, our sense of their irony is eroding. It didn’t take long for us to shift from tracking calories to tracking interactions with friends, to move from using tracking technology to live healthier to using it find meaning.</p>

    <p>Numbers quantify things; they are meant for quantifiable things. That said, they aren't meaningless as profound personal artifacts. I have two parents, who have traveled countless miles to visit me, given countless hours caring for me. These are important, uncharted numbers. What matters, and what deserves representation, is the <em>nature</em> of their care, the <em>quality</em> of their love. This is the kind of representation artists give their lives to, the unquantifiable, invisible realities of our lives. By attempting to discern the meaning of our days in charts and graphs we’re training ourselves in an impossible sort of introspection and avoiding the work of putting words and images to meanings.</p>

    <p>Felton uses numbers to quantify unquantifiable things, treating relationships, thoughts, feelings, and  interactions as data – the ironic clash of objectivity and subjectivity. His work represents a numerical vision of life that sees the world as connected points of data, the kind of vision epitomized by the Silicon Valley enterprise. I would contrast this with an empathetic vision, which imagines complexities and relationships without giving in to the impulse to reduce, or simplify, or quantify. Each are ways of finding hidden resonances and patterns. One is reductive, however, while the other is expansive. One categorizes, the other connects. One is the realm of digital technology, the other the realm of novelists and painters. One reveals the personal with numbers, the other the personal with words and colors. They tell different types of stories.</p>

    <p>I think of the end of <em>The Matrix</em>, when Neo “sees” the Matrix: the binary underpinnings of the Matrix. This is the dream of the numerical imagination, the full revelation of all measurements. The world that Neo sees, however, is the false world - the world the robots made. The real world is made of flesh and blood and dirt, not a frictionless set of circuits. Felton’s and Neo’s are reverse epiphanies: Neo sees the truth of a distortion, Felton visualizes a reduction of the truth.</p>
