<p class="salutation"> Dear Linear, </p>

<p>When we switched to Linear at <a href="https://whimsical.com">Whimsical</a>, it quickly became clear that the hype was justified. You’ve done with project management what we’ve sought to do with visual collaboration: bring a high level of simplicity, sophistication, and integration to a staid product category. And so, joining the ranks of every other designer in tech, I found myself on your careers page.</p>

<p>Yet I’m drawn to Linear not only for your level of design craft and strategic focus, but for the potential your tool has to meaningfully shape modern work. While Linear may be the current standard for project management, I believe it can be the future of <i>product shaping</i>—supporting the freeform, ambiguous work that teams do when figuring out what to do.<sup><a href="#sup1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>No other project management tools are set up for this. Asana is <span class="gif-hover asana">straining under the weight</span> of its enterprise ties. Github Issues is fine but non-engineers are <span class="gif-hover github">scared of Github</span>. Don’t get me started on <span class="gif-hover jira">Jira</span>. And, for all its virtues, Notion requires <span class="gif-hover notion">too much overhead</span> to set up and manage projects at scale. Product teams are getting by with an amalgamation of tools, none of which are purpose-built for interconnected shaping and planning.</p>

<p>The problem with each of these products is their rigid understanding of how teams plan. At Whimsical, I led the design<sup><a href="#sup2">2</a></sup> of core editing and collaborative features and saw firsthand how product teams use Whimsical for early-stage ideation. Planning is a decidedly non-linear act (pun unintended) that takes many forms,<sup><a href="#sup3">3</a></sup> especially in the early stages when working with ideas, not projects.</p>

<p>I don’t know where you want to take Linear. But having noticed some of the recent work you’ve been doing with docs and text editing in the app, I sense that you’re exploring a strategy that moves in the direction of supporting more open-ended planning work. And this potential is exciting to me, given my interest and background<sup><a href="#sup4">4</a></sup> in designing purpose-built digital tools that help others to work better.</p>

<p>I’ve been a product designer for the last eleven years in agency and in-house environments, where I’ve worked on a range of products, platforms, and teams. My ideal setup is small product teams, where I get to work closely with engineers to shape, prototype, and polish features, have direct contact with users, and build something I believe in. Please see my resume and case studies for more information about me.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I’d love the opportunity to join Linear.
