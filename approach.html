        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>04 February 2015</p>
        <p>A working design philosophy.</p>
      </header>
      

      <p>An approach is a posture toward a project, the way one thinks about and does their work. That said, approach isn't a recipe. An approach is a way, a technique is a means. So while I use specific methods and seek to use them well, I try to keep any particular technique from dictating the course of my work.</p>

      <p>Four phases loosely constitute my approach  <em>listen</em>, <em>connect</em>, <em>design</em>, and <em>produce</em>. These are an adaptation of the fourfold creative process espoused by <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>, <a href="http://13pt.com/corum/">Jonathan Corum</a>, and <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/about/">Maria Popova</a> in their presentation “See, Think, Design, Produce.” Because the process doesn’t prescribe any particular methods, it is widely applicable. It requires the designer to think critically and be sensitive to the context and nuances of the project, rather than rely on a thoughtless prescription. This is my interpretation of their approach, modified by reflections on my personal experience as a user experience designer.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-1">Listen</h2>

      <p>All design begins in <a href="https://ia.net/know-how/putting-thought-into-things">listening</a>. Listening is learning, seeing, hearing, attending, all of which are the opposite of <em>presuming</em>. Listening to others, learning about situations, looking for clues, listening to our hunches. When we listen, we get ourselves out of the way so that we can hear what someone is actually saying and come to see the reality of a situation. Listening is a profoundly intentional act, because it requires that we overcome the tendency to prescribe answers. It is also a humble act, because we expose our ignorance when we ask honest questions.</p>

      <p>All design begins in listening because design is the forever attempt to improve our circumstances, and the only way we can know what is wrong is through sensitivity to context. Listening holds first impressions lightly. And listening is the natural corollary of curiosity: talking with people, reading about relevant subjects, studying the ways a problem has been solved before (how others have succeeded and failed).</p>

      <p>At the outset each design project I seek to inhabit a posture of receptiveness, to avoid trying to shoehorn ill-fitting, well-trodden solutions into unique design problems.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p>User research methods provide the means of listening for a user experience designer. Depending on the project I'll do one or more of the following: stakeholder interviews, standards research, information taxonomy, card sorts, and contextual inquiry.</p>

      <img src="img/connect.svg" class="center mt-5" style="max-width: 140px" alt="Illustration of a connections between notes.">

      <h2 class="mt-1">Connect</h2>

      <p>We make sense of things by connecting: finding the relationships between this and that. If listening is about gathering information, connecting is about making sense of it. When we connect, we look for patterns (things that repeat) and incongruities (things that don’t jive). Patterns help account for similarity among diversity, and shape the form of a logical system. Incongruities – the outliers and oddities – are just as important, for they can indicate the presence of deeper, less obvious realities. When something doesn’t fit a model, that means the model isn’t nuanced or big enough; the model doesn’t reflect reality, and needs to be revised. So we relate and revise, relate and revise.</p>

      <p>My tools for connecting are basic. I like to use paper, pencil, and post-its to take notes, cluster ideas and questions, and freely discuss thoughts with my teammates. Connecting is a relatively messy task (think those cork boards in detective offices covered in pushpinned photos and printouts and sketches), yet the diagrams, notes, summaries, and briefs that emerge at the end become the tools of thought for the rest of the design process.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p> Connecting is the work of information architecture, when one creates logical presentations and organizations of information. To that end, I often make user flows, Excel tables, strategic briefs, user personas, and visual sketches to record and explore the content of a project.</p>

      <img src="img/design.svg" class="center mt-5" style="max-width: 140px" alt="Illustration of some interfaces.">

      <h2 class="mt-1">Design</h2>

      <p>The word “design” comes from the Latin <em>designare,</em> from which we get the word “designate.” So, to design is to give something intention, to put thought into a thing. Design gives shape to an idea. It gives an idea some work clothes.</p>

      <p>By this point data has been gathered, some sense has been made of it, and we have the material and direction needed to design. Sketching is the best way to experiment with forms to fit the content of any project. As Jonathan Corum points out, a sketch isn’t a commitment. It’s an attempt. When I sketch, I don’t concern myself with final products, but am instead trying to come up with micro and macro systems appropriate to the data. </p>

      <p>I find it necessary to take on a childlike, playful seriousness when designing. Watching children play at dolls or Legos, you notice their all-consuming attentiveness to the activity as they enact what they imagine. They are caught up in their own world of rules and possibilities, unaware of the norms around them. This spirit of play creates in the designer an openness to possibilities that may or may not suit the project. It’s a kind of intellectual pliability. The first ideas are rarely the best, yet the cutting room floor isn’t covered with trash; it’s covered in something more like a wood-carver’s shavings, scattered as he hones his art.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p>The moment one starts drawing a web page, one takes on the role of an interaction designer. I move through increasing levels of fidelity as I find forms for representing data, moving from paper sketches, wireframes, to browser prototypes.</p>

      <img src="img/produce.svg" class="center mt-5" style="max-width: 140px" alt="Illustration of an interface on a laptop.">

      <h2 class="mt-1">Produce</h2>

      <p>To produce is to bring something out of the realm of the possible into the actual. Listening gathers information; connecting makes sense of it; designing puts form to it; producing makes it accessible to others. The act of production brings the considerations of a product’s use and interpretation into sharp focus, which is why prototyping is helpful. Indeed, why prototyping is <em>necessary.</em></p>

      <p>Usability feedback protects a digital product from failure, yet doesn’t guarantee its success. So while production may be the final test of an idea, it really begins the influx of real, out-in-the-wild usage data. Paying attention to this qualitative and quantitative data is the production task of user experience designers who are determined not simply to make a thing, but to solve a problem.</p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p>When creating web applications with development teams, I provide usability input and act as keeper-of-the-stylesheets. If we're going through phases of prototyping, I lead usability tests and gather usability metrics; if an application has been released, I cultivate consistent feedback loops.</p>
