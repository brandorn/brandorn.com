								<p>I'm a User Experience designer with a background in the humanities. The kinds of projects I take on usually involve making sense of data, interaction, and context in digital products - the kind of complexity that inspires me to take up graph paper and pencil each day.</p>
								<p>I got my start in brand strategy, where I learned that thinking about people &mdash; the kind of thinking I did as a Literature major &mdash; could solve meaningful business problems. After that, I began designing development tools and visualizations &mdash; a gauntlet that introduced me to UX, technical infrastructures, and gave me an allergy to visual superfluity in design.</p>
        <p>My work is marked by a mindful attempt to pare interfaces and visualizations down to their essential form and function. Currently I work for State Farm on internal cloud hosting applications.</p>
        <hr>
								<p><i>Liberal Art</i> is a series of reflections triangulated by design, art, and belief. I'm curious about how the three spheres relate, following an intuition that they are analogies of each other. I've written more about the project and its appellation <a href="writing/2015/on-liberal-art">here</a>.</p>

								<p>Process can be a distraction. Instead of strict adherence to a set of methodologies, I approach projects Socratically, led by the questions they generate and the answers they require, using methodologies mindfully rather than prescriptively. A balance of naivet&eacute; and critical thought is key, however, for a beginner's mind doesn't mean an empty head.</p>
        <p>That said, I've come to recognize three general phases of my and my teams' projects, which constitute a loosely-defined process. The phases necessarily overlap and may be returned to throughout the project lifecycle &mdash; directions invariably evolve in response to circumstances and discoveries &mdash; yet each has its distinct purpose.</p><p><b>Methods depend on point in the lifecycle, time, etc.</b></p>

          <h3>Gather</h3>
          <p>First, people, and learning about them. Sometimes I start working with a development team at the outset of a project, other times I'm asked to come in to help revise an application. Either way, I need to orient myself to purposes and audiences. At this point I'm collecting two things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><b>Notes on the project itself.</b> These are not ideas toward a solution, but a sense of the purpose, limits, and aspirations of the project. This gives focus to the collecting, but not so much so that it's prescribing a path.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Material for thought.</b> These are the twigs for the nest. And like birds building their home, gathering sticks, leaves, tinsel, I'm broad in my collecting. I research more than what the project immediately requires in an attempt to reach beyond the &ldquo;data of convenience&rdquo;.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>I gather and outline ideas and information with only enough discretion as to not be distracted from the central task. It's a kind of resourceful collecting that generates the material of possibility.</p>

          <p>Next, I start to relate what I've found. Think those boards in detective offices with the pictures and newspaper clips and thread and pushpins. Relationships are how we discover meaning, start to make sense of what we've observed. It's how we create order.</p>
          <p>I may still gather information at this point, yet am more concerned with identifying patterns and tensions. These are the interesting things, clues to the actual issues at hand. Questions lead to connections which lead to discoveries. I approach each project with the assumption that meaning exists to be found and conveyed, bringing a robust optimism to all that I do.</p>

          <h3>Iterate</h3>
          <p>Wireframes, prototypes, mockups, cycle. Define assumptions, test them... I've written about <a href="#">agile UX</a>, a methodology I've found useful for development projects in a team context.</p>
          <p>The efficiency of moving from low to high fidelity can't be overstated. Depending on the point in the project lifecycle, I'm now translating sketches into wireframes, or going straight from sketches to the browser. For the first iteration of a project, I like to follow a relatively basic workflow involving Illustrator and InDesign which results in a set of comprehensive wireframes(Matt Smith provides an excellent <a href="http://mds.is/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/">overview</a> of his workflow, from which I've gathered ideas for my own). Otherwise, I take a handful of sketches and get cracking on the HTML, CSS, and jQuery.</p>
