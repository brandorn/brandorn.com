								<p>I'm a User Experience designer with a background in the humanities. The kinds of projects I take on usually involve making sense of data, interaction, and context in digital products - the kind of complexity that inspires me to take up graph paper and pencil each day.</p>
								<p>I got my start in brand strategy, where I learned that thinking about people - the kind of thinking I did as a Literature major - could solve meaningful business problems. After that I began designing development tools and dashboards, a gauntlet that introduced me to UX and began my indoctrination in the principles of efficient design. My work is marked by a mindful attempt to pare interfaces and visualizations down to their essential form and function. Currently I work for State Farm on internal cloud hosting applications.</p>
								<p><i>Liberal Art</i> is a series of reflections triangulated by design, art, and belief. I'm curious about how the three spheres relate, following an intuition that they are analogies of each other. I've written more about the project and its appellation <a href="writing/2015/on-liberal-art">here</a>.</p>

								<h2>Process</h2>
								<p>Process can be a distraction. Projects should instead be approached Socratically, led by the questions that they generate and the answers they require, so that methodologies are used mindfully rather than prescriptively.</p>
        <p>That said, I've come to recognize three general phases that projects usually go through, which constitute a loosely-defined process. They necessarily overlap, yet each has its distinct purpose.</p>


        <div class="steps">
          <img src="img/gather.svg">
          <h3>Gather</h3>
          <p>Before I can think about something, I need something to think about. At this point I'm collecting two things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><b>Notes on the project itself.</b> These are not ideas toward a solution, but a sense of the purpose, limits, and aspirations of the project. This gives focus to the collecting, but not so much so that it's prescribing a path.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Material for thought.</b> These are the twigs for the nest. And like birds building their home, gathering sticks, leaves, tinsel, and dirt, I try to be as broad as possible when collecting ideas, visual and otherwise. I research more than what the task immediately requires in an attempt to find ideas that aren't merely convenient. Now is the time for telescopic vision; the microscope comes out later.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>I gather and outline ideas and information, with only enough discrimination as to not be distracted from the central task. It's a kind of scrappy collecting which generates a stew of possibilities.</p>
          
          <ul class="methods">
            <li>Methods</li>
            <li>User interviews</li>
            <li>Rough sketches</li>
            <li>Image collages</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="steps">
          <img src="img/connect.svg">
          <h3>Connect</h3>
          <p>Next, I start to relate what I've found. Think those boards in detective offices with the pictures and newspaper clips and thread and pushpins. Relationships are how we discover meaning, start to make sense of what we've observed. It's how we create order.</p>
          <p>I may still gather information at this point, yet am more concerned with identifying patterns and tensions. These are the interesting things, clues to the actual issues at hand. Questions lead to connections which lead to discoveries. I approach each project with the assumption that meaning exists to be found and conveyed. Call it a robust optimism.</p>
