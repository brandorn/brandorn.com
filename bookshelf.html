          <p class="author">Erin Anderson; et al</p>
          <p>While resources like Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and Codecademy provide useful guidance on specific development languages, it's hard to know where to start and how things fit together when first getting a lay of the web development land. This book is where I started when I wanted to learn to code. Written by a variety of talented developers and educators, it's a broad yet straightforward (and surprisingly up-to-date, for being five years old) guide to making things for the web, and proved a helpful complement to online tutorials.</p>

          <p class="author">Abby Covert</p>
          <p>Information architecture got its start in library sciences, and comes with an intimidating vocabulary that obscures the common sense nature of the discipline. Organizing information. Making it accessible and useful for others. Creating flexible categories and systems. Abby Covert presents the insights and processes of information architecture through a series of thoughtful reflections and lessons that show how to gracefully deal with information messes of all kinds.</p>

          <p class="author">CS Lewis</p>
          <p>Literary theory has given literary criticism a bad name. This is a theory of reading that does what criticism should do: eagerly return us to books. Lewis had an abiding love for the act of reading and the life of the imagination, and here presents a refreshing, sane account of how we should think about books. He argues that the worth of a book should be determined by the <em>kind</em> of reading it requires of us. I return to <em>Experiment</em> when I need to be reminded about literature's transformative effect on our lives, and how to read with humility and openness.</p>

          <p class="author">Marilynne Robinson</p>
          <p>Robinson writes with the understated power and grace of a prairie sunset smoldering quietly over the Midwestern plains. The novel is a series of letters written from an ailing pastor in rural Iowa to his son, late-begotten in life, whom he knows he will not see grow up. Above all, these letters stand testament to the sacredness of life, and to the dignity of our joys and sorrows. They show us that meaning is found not in trying to escape our quotidian existence, but in living attentively where we find ourselves.</p>

          <p class="author">Carl Sandburg</p>
          <p>Although Carl Sandburg was a serious man – he fought for labor rights during the Industrial Revolution through politics and poetry – he also wrote playful children's literature. I keep this collection of non sequiturs, folk wisdom, and strange, lovely short stories nearby for whenever I need respite from the intellectual intensity of a project or class. Sandburg reminds me that sometimes it's the silly things that bring us back to sanity.</p>

          <h2><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/maps-of-the-imagination-the-writer-as-cartographer/oclc/886674947">Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer</a></h2>
          <p class="author">Peter Turchi</p>
          <p>Using the metaphor of mapmaking, Peter Turchi makes an account of the writer's imaginative work by charting the connections between the verbal and visual arts. Like a good cartographer, Turchi explains without oversimplifying, explores without getting lost. What we're given is a conversation about creativity that preserves the inherent mystery of meaning-making while giving us signposts for finding our way. The book is beautifully designed, to boot.</p>

          <p class="author">Virginia Woolf</p>
          <p>Woolf had a genius intuition for the nuances and complexities of relationships, and had the imaginative talent to present them through flesh-and-blood characters. <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> was one of the first novels to experiment with stream-of-consciousness prose, yet, reading it, one doesn't detect the experiment at all. It simply feels like living inside another person's mind as they navigate their quiet despairs and hopes.</p>
